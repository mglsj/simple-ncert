## 4.1 Introduction ||section-4.1||

Today, computers are all around us. We use them for doing various tasks in a
faster and more accurate manner. For example, using a computer or smartphone, we
can book train tickets online.

India is a big country and we have an enormous railway network. Thus, railway
reservation is a complex task. Making reservation involves information about
many aspects, such as details of trains (train type, types of berth and
compartments in each train, their schedule, etc.), simultaneous booking of
tickets by multiple users and many other related factors.

It is only due to the use of computers that today, the booking of the train
tickets has become easy. Online booking of train tickets has added to our
comfort by enabling us to book tickets from anywhere, anytime.

We usually use the term computerisation to indicate the use of computer to
develop software in order to automate any routine human task efficiently.
Computers are used for solving various day-to-day problems and thus problem
solving is an essential skill that a computer science student should know. It is
pertinent to mention that computers themselves cannot solve a problem. Precise
step-by-step instructions should be given by us to solve the problem. Thus, the
success of a computer in solving a problem depends on how correctly and
precisely we define the problem, design a solution (algorithm) and implement the
solution (program) using a programming language. Thus, problem solving is the
process of identifying a problem, developing an algorithm for the identified
problem and finally implementing the algorithm to develop a computer program.

The correctness of the output that a computer gives depends upon the correctness
of input provided.

### 4.2 Steps for Problem Solving ||section-4.2||

Suppose while driving, a vehicle starts making a strange noise. We might not
know how to solve the problem right away. First, we need to identify from where
the noise is coming? In case the problem cannot be solved by us, then we need to
take the vehicle to a mechanic. The mechanic will analyse the problem to
identify the source of the noise, make a plan about the work to be done and
finally repair the vehicle in order to remove the noise. From the above example,
it is explicit that, finding the solution to a problem might consist of multiple
steps.

When problems are straightforward and easy, we can easily find the solution. But
a complex problem requires a methodical approach to find the right solution. In
other words, we have to apply problem solving techniques. Problem solving begins
with the precise identification of the problem and ends with a complete working
solution in terms of a program or software. Key steps required for solving a
problem using a computer are shown in [Figure 4.1](#figure-4.1) and are discussed in following
subsections.

### 4.2.1 Analysing the problem ||section-4.2.1||

It is important to clearly understand a problem before we begin to find the
solution for it. If we are not clear as to what is to be solved, we may end up
developing a program which may not solve our purpose. Thus, we need to read and
analyse the problem statement carefully in order to list the principal
components of the problem and decide the core functionalities that our solution
should have. By analysing a problem, we would be able to figure out what are the
inputs that our program should accept and the outputs that it should produce.

### 4.2.2 Developing an Algorithm ||section-4.2.2||

It is essential to device a solution before writing a program code for a given
problem. The solution is represented in natural language and is called an
algorithm. We can imagine an algorithm like a very well-written recipe for a
dish, with clearly defined steps that, if followed, one will end up preparing
the dish.

:::tip[Algorithm]

A set of exact steps which when followed, solve the problem or accomplish the
required task.

:::

We start with a tentative solution plan and keep on refining the algorithm until
the algorithm is able to capture all the aspects of the desired solution. For a
given problem, more than one algorithm is possible and we have to select the
most suitable solution. The algorithm is discussed in [section 4.3](#section-4.3).

### 4.2.3 Coding ||section-4.2.3||

After finalising the algorithm, we need to convert the algorithm into the format
which can be understood by the computer to generate the desired solution.
Different high level programming languages can be used for writing a program.

It is equally important to record the details of the coding procedures followed
and document the solution. This is helpful when revisiting the programs at a
later stage. Coding is explained in detail in [section 4.8](#section-4.8).

### 4.2.4 Testing and Debugging ||section-4.2.4||

The program created should be tested on various parameters. The program should
meet the requirements of the user. It must respond within the expected time. It
should generate correct output for all possible inputs. In the presence of
syntactical errors, no output will be obtained. In case the output generated is
incorrect, then the program should be checked for logical errors, if any.

Software industry follows standardised testing methods like unit or component
testing, integration testing, system testing, and acceptance testing while
developing complex applications. This is to ensure that the software meets all
the business and technical requirements and works as expected. The errors or
defects found in the testing phases are debugged or rectified and the program is
again tested. This continues till all the errors are removed from the program.

Once the software application has been developed, tested and delivered to the
user, still problems in terms of functioning can come up and need to be resolved
from time to time. The maintenance of the solution, thus, involves fixing the
problems faced by the user, answering the queries of the user and even serving
the request for addition or modification of features.

## 4.3 Algorithm ||section-4.3||

In our day-to-day life we perform activities by following certain sequence of
steps. Examples of activities include getting ready for school, making
breakfast, riding a bicycle, wearing a tie, solving a puzzle and so on. To
complete each activity, we follow a sequence of steps. Suppose following are the
steps required for an activity 'riding a bicycle':

1. remove the bicycle from the stand,
2. sit on the seat of the bicycle,
3. start peddling,
4. use breaks whenever needed and
5. stop on reaching the destination.

Let us now find Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of two numbers 45 and 54.

**Note:** GCD is the largest number that divides both the given numbers.

<Steps>

1. Find the numbers (divisors) which can divide the given numbers
   ```
   Divisors of 45 are: 1, 3, 5, 9, 15, and 45 
   Divisors of 54 are: 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, 18, 27, and 54
   ```

2. Then find the largest common number from these two lists.
   ```
   Therefore, GCD of 45 and 54 is 9
   ```

</Steps>

Hence, it is clear that we need to follow a sequence of steps to accomplish the
task. Such a finite sequence of steps required to get the desired output is
called an algorithm. It will lead to the desired result in a finite amount of
time, if followed correctly. Algorithm has a definite beginning and a definite
end, and consists of a finite number of steps.

### 4.3.1 Why do we need an Algorithm? ||section-4.3.1||

A programmer writes a program to instruct the computer to do certain tasks as
desired. The computer then follows the steps written in the program code.
Therefore, the programmer first prepares a roadmap of the program to be written,
before actually writing the code. Without a roadmap, the programmer may not be
able to clearly visualise the instructions to be written and may end up
developing a program which may not work as expected.

Such a roadmap is nothing but the algorithm which is the building block of a
computer program. For example, searching using a search engine, sending a
message, finding a word in a document, booking a taxi through an app, performing
online banking, playing computer games, all are based on algorithms.

Writing an algorithm is mostly considered as a first step to programming. Once
we have an algorithm to solve a problem, we can write the computer program for
giving instructions to the computer in high level language. If the algorithm is
correct, computer will run the program correctly, every time. So, the purpose of
using an algorithm is to increase the reliability, accuracy and efficiency of
obtaining solutions.

**(A) Characteristics of a good algorithm**

- Precision — the steps are precisely stated or defined.
- Uniqueness — results of each step are uniquely defined and only depend on the
  input and the result of the preceding steps.
- Finiteness — the algorithm always stops after a finite number of steps.
- Input — the algorithm receives some input.
- Output — the algorithm produces some output.

**(B) While writing an algorithm, it is required to clearly identify the
following:**

- The input to be taken from the user
- Processing or computation to be performed to get the desired result
- The output desired by the user

## 4.4 Representation of Algorithms ||section-4.4||

Using their algorithmic thinking skills, the software designers or programmers
analyse the problem and identify the logical steps that need to be followed to
reach a solution. Once the steps are identified, the need is to write down these steps along with the
required input and desired output. There are two common methods of representing
an algorithm —flowchart and pseudocode. Either of the methods can be used to
represent an algorithm while keeping in mind the following:

- it showcases the logic of the problem solution, excluding any implementational
  details
- it clearly reveals the flow of control during execution of the program

### 4.4.1 Flowchart — Visual Representation of Algorithms ||section-4.4.1||

A flowchart is a visual representation of an algorithm. A flowchart is a diagram
made up of boxes, diamonds and other shapes, connected by arrows. Each shape
represents a step of the solution process and the arrow represents the order or
link among the steps.

There are standardised symbols to draw flowcharts. Some are given in [Table 4.1](#table-4.1).

### 4.4.2 Pseudocode ||section-4.4.2||

A pseudocode (pronounced _Soo-doh-kohd_) is another way of representing an
algorithm. It is considered as a non-formal language that helps programmers to
write algorithm. It is a detailed description of instructions that a computer
must follow in a particular order. It is intended for human reading and cannot
be executed directly by the computer. No specific standard for writing a
pseudocode exists. The word "pseudo" means "not real," so "pseudocode" means
"not real code". Following are some of the frequently used keywords while
writing pseudocode:

- INPUT
- COMPUTE
- PRINT
- INCREMENT
- DECREMENT
- IF/ELSE
- WHILE
- TRUE/FALSE

<Example id="4.3" title="Example 4.3">

Write an algorithm to display the sum of two numbers entered by user, using both

_**(A) Benefits of Pseudocode**_

Before writing codes in a high level language, a pseudocode of a program helps
in representing the basic functionality of the intended program. By writing the
code first in a human readable language, the programmer safeguards against
leaving out any important step. Besides, for non-programmers, actual programs
are difficult to read and understand, but pseudocode helps them to review the
steps to confirm that the proposed implementation is going to achieve the desire
output.

## 4.5 Flow of Control ||section-4.5||

The flow of control depicts the flow of events as represented in the flow chart.
The events can flow in a sequence, or on branch based on a decision or even
repeat some part for a finite number of times.

### 4.5.1 Sequence ||section-4.5.1||

If we look at the [examples 4.3](#example-4.3) and [4.4](#example-4.4), the statements are executed one after
another, i.e., in a sequence. Such algorithms where all the steps are executed
one after the other are said to execute in sequence. However, statements in an
algorithm may not always execute in a sequence. We may sometimes require the
algorithm to either do some routine tasks in a repeated manner or behave
differently depending on the outcomes of previous steps. In this section, we are
going to learn how to write algorithms for such situations.

### 4.5.2 Selection ||section-4.5.2||

Consider the map of a neighbourhood as shown in [Figure 4.6](#figure-4.6). Let us assume that
the pink building with the red roof is the school; the yellow painted house at
the far end of the map is a house.

<Figure 
  id="4.6" 
  title="Figure 4.6: Decision making in real life"
>
![Decision making in real life](./res/fig_4.6.svg)
</Figure>

<Think title="Think and Reflect">
Can you list some of the routine activities in your daily life where decision
making is involved?
</Think>

With reference to [Figure 4.6](#figure-4.6), let us answer the following questions:

- Is there a predefined route for walking from home to school?

- Can we have a different route while coming back?

As seen from the map, there can be multiple routes between home and school. We
might take the shortest route in the morning. But while coming back home in the
afternoon, the shortest route might have heavy traffic. Therefore, we could take
another route with less traffic. Hence, the above problem involves some
decision-making based on certain conditions. Let us look at some other examples
where decision making is dependent on certain conditions. For example,

- (i) _Checking eligibility for voting._ 
  
  Depending on their age, a person will either be allowed to vote or not allowed to vote:
  - If age is greater than or equal to 18, the person is eligible to vote
  - If age is less than 18, the person is not eligible to vote

- (ii) _Let us consider another example_

  If a student is 8 years old and the student likes Maths
  - put the student in Group A

  Otherwise
  - Put the student in Group B

In which group will these students go as per the above condition?

|                                         | Outcome |
| --------------------------------------- | ------- |
| 8-year-old Ravi who does not like Maths | Group B |
| 8-year-old Priti who likes Maths        | Group A |
| 7-year-old Anish who likes Maths        | Group B |

In these examples, any one of the alternatives is selected based on the outcome
of a condition. Conditionals are used to check possibilities. The program checks
one or more conditions and perform operations (sequence of actions) depending on
true or false value of the condition. These true or false values are called
binary values.

Conditionals are written in the algorithm as follows:

```
If <condition> then 
    steps to be taken when the 
condition is true/fulfilled
```

There are situations where we also need to take action when the condition is not
fulfilled ([Figure 4.7](#figure-4.7)). To represent that, we can write:

<Figure 
  id="4.7" 
  title="Figure 4.7: Actions depending on true or false of a condition"
>
<center>
```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A["Condition"]
    B["Do this"]
    C["Do that or do nothing"]

    A --True--> B
    A --False--> C
```
</center>
</Figure>

```
If <condition> is true then 
    steps to be taken when the condition is true/fulfilled 

otherwise 
    steps to be taken when the condition is false/not fulfilled
```

In programming languages, 'otherwise' is represented using Else keyword. Hence,
a true/false conditional is written using if-else block in actual programs.

<Example id="4.5" title="Example 4.5">

Let us write an algorithm to check whether a number is odd or even.

- Input: Any number
- Process: Check whether the number is even or not

PRINT "Enter the Number"

IF number MOD 2 == 0 THEN
  PRINT "Number is Even" 
ELSE 
  PRINT "Number is Odd"
```

Algorithm for a card game called "Dragons and Wizards".

Make two teams `DRAGONS` and `WIZARDS`

The rules for the game are as follows:

- If the card drawn is a diamond or a club, `Team DRAGONS` gets a point
- If the card drawn is a heart which is a number, `Team WIZARDS` gets a point
- If the card drawn is a heart that is not a number, `Team DRAGONS` gets a point
- For any other card, `Team WIZARDS` gets a point
- The team with highest point is the winner

Let us identify the following for a card:

- Input: shape, value
- Process: Increment in respective team scores by one based on the outcome of the
card drawn, as defined in the rules.
- Output: Winning team

Now let us write the conditionals for this game:

```py "Team DRAGONS" "Team WIZARDS"
IF (shape is diamond) OR (shape is club)
  Team DRAGONS gets a point 
ELSE IF (shape is heart) AND (value is number)
  Team WIZARDS gets a point 
ELSE IF (shape is heart) AND (value is not a number)
  Team DRAGONS gets a point 
ELSE 
  Team WIZARDS gets a point
```

The pseudocode for the program can be as follows:

**Note:** Dpoint (for Dragon) and Wpoint (for Wizard) store points scored by the
respective teams.

```py
INPUT shape 
INPUT value 
SET Dpoint = 0, Wpoint = 0 

IF (shape is diamond) OR (shape is club) THEN
  INCREMENT Dpoint 
ELSE IF (shape is heart) AND (value is number)THEN
  INCREMENT Wpoint 
ELSE IF (shape is heart) AND (value is not a number)THEN
  INCREMENT Dpoint 
ELSE
  INCREMENT Wpoint 
END IF 

IF Dpoint > Wpoint THEN 
  PRINT "Dragon team is the winner" 
ELSE 
  PRINT "Wizard team is the winner"
```

### 4.5.3 Repetition ||section-4.5.3||

When giving directions to go someplace, we say something like, "walk 50 steps
then turn right". Or "Walk till the next crossing then take a right turn".
Consider some other examples like:

- Clap your hands five times
- Walk 10 steps ahead
- Jump on the spot till you get tired

These are the kind of statements we use, when we want something to be done
repeatedly, for a given number of times. Likewise, suppose 10 cards need to be
withdrawn in the previous card game (example 4.7), then the pseudocode needs to
be repeated 10 times to decide the winner. All these are examples of
repetitions. In programming, repetition is also known as iteration or loop. A
loop in an algorithm means execution of some program statements repeatedly till
some specified condition is satisfied.

or iteration is involved?

In [example 4.8](#example-4.8), a counter called "count" keeps track of number of times the loop
has been repeated. After every iterationof the loop, the value of count is
incremented by 1 until it performs the set number of repetitions, given in the
iteration condition.

There are situations when we are not aware beforehand about the number of times
a set of statements need to be repeated. Such requirements of unknown number of
repetitions are handled using WHILE construct.

## 4.6 Verifying Algorithms ||section-4.6||

Can you imagine what would happen if a banking software does not work correctly?
Suppose functioning of the online money transfer module is not programmed
correctly, and it credits into the account only half the amount transacted! What
happens if the account is debited instead of being credited. Such a faulty
software will mess up the working of the complete system and cause havoc! Today
software are used in even more critical services — like in the medical field or
in space shuttles. Such software needs to work correctly in every situation.
Therefore, the software designer should make sure that the functioning of all
the components are defined correctly, checked and verified in every possible
way.

When we were told that the formula for the sum of first $N$ natural numbers is
$\frac{N(N+1)}{2}$ , how did we verify it?

Well, we can check this for small numbers, for which we can manually calculate
the sum. Let $N = 6$, then the sum is $1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 = 21$

Using formula we get sum $= \frac{6*(6+1)}{2}$

We can try with some more numbers this way to ensure that the formula works
correctly.

In the same way, when we have written an algorithm, we want to verify that it is
working as expected. To verify, we have to take different input values and go
through all the steps of the algorithm to yield the desired output for each
input value and may modify or improve as per the need. The method of taking an
input and running through the steps of the algorithm is sometimes called dry
run. Such a dry run will help us to:

1. Identify any incorrect steps in the algorithm
2. Figure out missing details or specifics in the algorithm

It is important to decide the type of input value to be used for the simulation.
In case all possible input values are not tested, then the program will fail.
What if there is some other case for which it does not work? Let us look at some
examples.

<Think title="Think and Reflect">
Why is verification of algorithm an important step in problem solving?
</Think>

<Activity id="4.5" title="Activity 4.5">

Write an algorithm to take as input the measurement of length and breadth in
feet and inches (e.g., 5 ft 6 inch) of a rectangular shape and calculate its
area and perimeter.

</Activity>

Write an algorithm to calculate the time taken to go from place A to C (T_total)
via B where time taken to go from A to B ($T1$) and B to C ($T2$) are given. That
is, we want the algorithm to add time given in hours and minutes. One way to
write the algorithm is:

```py
PRINT value for T1 
INPUT hh1 
INPUT mm1 
PRINT value for T2 
INPUT hh2 
INPUT mm2 
hh_total = hh1 + hh2 (Add hours) 
mm_total = mm1 + mm2 (Add mins) 
PRINT T_total as hh_total, mm_total
```

Now let us verify. Suppose the first example we take is $T1 = 5$ hrs $20$ mins and
$T2 = 7$ hrs $30$ mins. On dry run, we get the result $12$ hrs and $50$ mins. This looks
fine.

Now let us take another example where $T1 = 4$ hrs $50$ mins and $T2 = 2$ hrs $20$ mins,
and we end up getting the result as $6$ hrs $70$ mins which is not how we measure
time. The result should have been $7$ hrs $10$ mins.

With this second example we realise that our algorithm will work only when `mm1` $+$
`mm2` (`mm_total`) $< 60$. For all other cases, it will give us output not the way we
want. When `mm_total` $>= 60$, the algorithm should increase the sum of hours
(hh_total) by $1$ and reduce `mm_total` by $60$, i.e., (`mm_total` $- 60$). So the modified
algorithm will be:

```py
PRINT value for T1 
INPUT hh1 
INPUT mm1 
PRINT value for T2 
INPUT hh2 
INPUT mm2 
hh_total = hh1 + hh2 (Add hours) 
mm_total = mm1 + mm2 (Add mins) 
hh_total = hh1 + hh2 (Add hours) 
mm_total = mm1 + mm2 (Add mins) 
IF (mm_total >= 60) THEN
  hh_total = hh_total + 1 
  mm_total = mm_total - 60
PRINT T_total as hh_total, mm_total
```

Now we can simulate through algorithm for $T1 = 4$ hrs $50$ mins and $T2 = 2$ hrs $20$
mins, and get `T_total` = $7$ hrs and $10$ mins, which means the algorithm is working
correctly.

Suppose we develop some software without verifying the underlying algorithm and
if there are errors in the algorithm, then the software developed will not run.
Hence, it is important to verify an algorithm since the effort required to catch
and fix a mistake is minimal.

## 4.7 Comparison of Algorithm ||section-4.7||

There can be more than one approach to solve a problem using computer and hence
we can have more than one algorithm. Then one may ask which algorithm should be
used?

Consider the problem of finding whether a given number is prime or not. Prime
numbers are of great importance in computer science as they find application in
databases, security, file compression or decompression, modulation or
demodulation, etc. There can be four different ways to write algorithms to check
whether a given number is prime or not as shown below:

- (i) Starting with divisor 2, divide the given number (dividend) and check if
  there are any factors. Increase the divisor in each iteration and repeat the
  previous steps as long as divisor < dividend. If there is a factor, then the
  given number is not prime
- (ii) In (i), instead of testing all the numbers till the dividend, only test
  up to half of the given value (dividend) because the divisor can not be more
  than half of the dividend
- (iii) In method (i), only test up to the square root of the dividend (numbers)
- (iv) Given a prior list of prime number till 100, divide the given number by
  each number in the list. If not divisible by any number, then the number is a
  prime else it is not prime

All these four methods can check if a given number is prime or not. Now the
question is which of these methods is better or efficient?

Algorithm (i) requires large number of calculations (means more processing time)
as it checks for all the numbers as long as the divisor is less than the number.
If the given number is large, this method will take more time to give the
output.

<Know title="Now you know">

The spirit of problem solving by decomposition is to 'divide and conquer'. In
words of Howard Raffa, a famous mathematician:

_"Decompose a complex problem into simpler problems get one's thinking straight
in these simpler problems, put these analyses together with logical glue"_

</Know>

Algorithm (ii) is more efficient than (i) as it checks for divisibility till
half the number, and thus it reduces the time for computation of the prime
number. Algorithm (iii) is even more efficient as it checks for divisibility
till square root of the number, thereby further reducing the time taken.

As algorithm (iv) uses only the prime numbers smaller than the given number for
divisibility, it further reduces the calculations. But in this method we require
to store the list of prime numbers first. Thus it takes additional memory even
though it requires lesser calculations.

Hence, algorithms can be compared and analysed on the basis of the amount of
processing time they need to run and the amount of memory that is needed to
execute the algorithm. These are termed as time complexity and space complexity,
respectively. The choice of an algorithm over another is done depending on how
efficient they are in terms of proecssing time required (time complexity) and
the memory they utilise (space complexity).

## 4.8 Coding ||section-4.8||

Once an algorithm is finalised, it should be coded in a high-level programming
language as selected by the programmer. The ordered set of instructions are
written in that programming language by following its syntax. Syntax is the set
of rules or grammar that governs the formulation of the statements in the
language, such as spellings, order of words, punctuation, etc.

The machine language or low level language consisting of 0s and 1s only is the
ideal way to write a computer program. Programs written using binary digits are
directly understood by the computer hardware, but they are difficult to deal
with and comprehend by humans. This led to the invention of high-level languages
which are close to natural languages and are easier to read, write, and
maintain, but are not directly understood by the computer hardware. An advantage
of using high-level languages is that they are portable, i.e., they can run on
different types of computers with little or no modifications. Low-level programs
can run on only one kind of computer and have to be rewritten in order to run on
another type of system. A wide variety of high-level languages, such as FORTRAN,
C, C++, Java, Python, etc., exist.

A program written in a high-level language is called source code. We need to
translate the source code into machine language using a compiler or an
interpreter, so that it can be understood by the computer. We have learnt about
the compiler and interpreter in [Chapter 1](../chapter-01/).

There are multiple programming languages available and choosing the one suitable
for our requirements requires us to consider many factors. It depends on the
platform (OS) where the program will run. We need to decide whether the
application would be a desktop application, a mobile application or a web
application. Desktop and mobile applications are generally developed for a
particular operating system and for certain hardware whereas the web
applications are accessed in different devices using web browsers and may use
resources available over cloud.

Besides, programs are developed not only to work on a computer, mobile or a web
browser, but it may also be written for embedded systems like digital watch, mp3
players, traffic signals or vehicles, medical equipments and other smart
devices. In such cases, we have to look for other specialised programming tools
or sometimes write programs in assembly languages.

## 4.9 Decomposition ||section-4.9||

Sometimes a problem may be complex, that is, its solution is not directly
derivable. In such cases, we need to decompose it into simpler parts. Let us
look at the Railway reservation system we talked about earlier. The complex task
of designing a good railway reservation system is seen as designing the
different components of the system and then making them work with each other
effectively.

The basic idea of solving a complex problem by decomposition is to 'decompose'
or break down a complex problem into smaller sub problems as shown in [Figure
4.12](#figure-4.12). These sub problems are relatively easier to solve than the original
problem. Finally, the subproblems are combined in a logical way to obtain the
solution for the bigger, main problem.

<Figure 
  id="4.12" 
  title="Figure 4.12: Railway reservation system"

| Food service | Billing service | Other details about railways |
</center>
</Figure>

Breaking down a complex problem into sub problems also means that each sub
problem can be examined in detail. Each sub problem can be solved independently
and by different persons (or teams). Having different teams working on different
sub problems can also be advantageous because specific sub problems can be
assigned to teams who are experts in solving such problems.

There are many real life problems which can be solved using decomposition.
Examples include solving problems in mathematics and science, events management
in school, weather forecasting, delivery management system, etc.

Once the individual sub problems are solved, it is necessary to test them for
their correctness and integrate them to get the complete solution.
