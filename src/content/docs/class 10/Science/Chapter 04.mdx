"Facts are not science — as the dictionary is not literature."

</Quote>

Consider the following situations of daily life and think what happens when -

- milk is left at room temperature during summers.
- an iron tawa/pan/nail is left exposed to humid atmosphere.
- grapes get fermented.
- food is cooked.
- food gets digested in our body.
- we respire.

In all the above situations, the nature and the identity of the initial
substance have somewhat changed. We have already learnt about physical and
chemical changes of matter in our previous classes. Whenever a chemical change
occurs, we can say that a chemical reaction has taken place.

You may perhaps be wondering as to what is actually meant by a chemical
reaction. How do we come to know that a chemical reaction has taken place? Let
us perform some activities to find the answer to these questions.

<Activity id="1.1" title="Activity 1.1">
<Aside type="danger" title="CAUTION">
This Activity needs the teacher's assistance. It would be better if
students wear suitable eyeglasses.
</Aside>

- Clean a magnesium ribbon about $3-4cm$ long by rubbing 
  it with sandpaper.
- Hold it with a pair of tongs. Burn it using a spirit lamp or burner and
  collect the ash so formed in a watch-glass as shown in [Fig. 1.1](#figure-1.1). Burn the
  magnesium ribbon keeping it away as far as possible from your eyes.
- What do you observe?
</Activity>

You must have observed that magnesium ribbon burns with a dazzling white flame
and changes into a white powder. This powder is magnesium oxide. It is formed
due to the reaction between magnesium and oxygen present in the air.

<Activity id="1.2" title="Activity 1.2">
- Take lead nitrate solution in a test tube.
- Add potassium iodide solution to this.
- What do you observe?
</Activity>

<Activity id="1.3" title="Activity 1.3">
- Take a few zinc granules in a conical flask or a test tube.
- Add dilute hydrochloric acid or sulphuric acid to this ([Fig. 1.2](#figure-1.2)).
  <Aside type="danger" title="CAUTION">
    Handle the acid with care.
  </Aside>
- Do you observe anything happening around the zinc granules?
- Touch the conical flask or test tube. Is there any change in its temperature?
</Activity>

From the above three activities, we can say that any of the following
observations helps us to determine whether a chemical reaction has taken place -

- change in state
- change in colour
- evolution of a gas
- change in temperature.

As we observe the changes around us, we can see that there is a large variety of
chemical reactions taking place around us. We will study about the various types
of chemical reactions and their symbolic representation in this Chapter.

## 1.1 CHEMICAL EQUATIONS

[Activity 1.1](#activity-1.1) can be described as - when a magnesium ribbon is burnt in oxygen,
it gets converted to magnesium oxide. This description of a chemical reaction in
a sentence form is quite long. It can be written in a shorter form. The simplest
way to do this is to write it in the form of a word-equation.

The word-equation for the above reaction would be -

$$ 
\tag{1.1} 
\ce{
    \underset{(Reactants)}{Magnesium + Oxygen}
    ->
    \underset{(Product)}{Magnesium oxide}
} 
$$

The substances that undergo chemical change in the reaction ([1.1](#equation-1.1)), magnesium and
oxygen, are the reactants. The new substance is magnesium oxide, formed during
the reaction, as a product.

A word-equation shows change of reactants to products through an arrow placed
between them. The reactants are written on the left-hand side (LHS) with a plus
sign ($\ce{+}$) between them. Similarly, products are written on the right-hand side
(RHS) with a plus sign ($\ce{+}$) between them. The arrowhead points towards the
products, and shows the direction of the reaction.

### 1.1.1 Writing a Chemical Equation

Is there any other shorter way for representing chemical equations? Chemical
equations can be made more concise and useful if we use chemical formulae
instead of words. A chemical equation represents a chemical reaction. If you
recall formulae of magnesium, oxygen and magnesium oxide, the above
word-equation can be written as -

$$
\tag{1.2}
\ce{Mg + O2 -> MgO}
$$

Count and compare the number of atoms of each element on the LHS and RHS of the
arrow. Is the number of atoms of each element the same on both the sides? If
yes, then the equation is balanced. If not, then the equation is unbalanced
because the mass is not the same on both sides of the equation. Such a chemical
equation is a skeletal chemical equation for a reaction. [Equation (1.2)](#equation-1.2) is a
skeletal chemical equation for the burning of magnesium in air.

### 1.1.2 Balanced Chemical Equations

Recall the law of conservation of mass that you studied in Class IX; mass can
neither be created nor destroyed in a chemical reaction. That is, the total mass
of the elements present in the products of a chemical reaction has to be equal
to the total mass of the elements present in the reactants.

In other words, the number of atoms of each element remains the same, before and
after a chemical reaction. Hence, we need to balance a skeletal chemical
equation. Is the chemical [Eq. (1.2)](#equation-1.2) balanced? Let us learn about balancing a
chemical equation step by step.

The word-equation for [Activity 1.3](#activity-1.3) may be represented as -

$$ 
\ce{

    Zinc + Sulphuric acid -> Zinc sulphate + Hydrogen

} 
$$

The above word-equation may be represented by the following chemical equation -

$$
\tag{1.3}
\ce{Zn + H2SO4 -> ZnSO4 + H2}
$$

Let us examine the number of atoms of different elements on both sides of the
arrow.

<Table>
| Element   | Number of atoms in reactants (LHS) | Number of atoms in products (RHS) |
| --------- | ---------------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| $\ce{Zn}$ | 1                                  | 1                                 |
| $\ce{H}$  | 2                                  | 2                                 |
| $\ce{S}$  | 1                                  | 1                                 |
| $\ce{O}$  | 4                                  | 4                                 |
</Table>

As the number of atoms of each element is the same on both sides of the arrow,
[Eq. (1.3)](#equation-1.3) is a balanced chemical equation.

Let us try to balance the following chemical equation -

$$
\tag{1.4}
\ce{Fe + H2O -> Fe3O4 + H2}
$$

<Steps>

1. To balance a chemical equation, first draw boxes around each formula. Do not
   change anything inside the boxes while balancing the equation.

   $$
    \tag{1.5}
    \ce{Fe + H2O -> Fe3O4 + H2}
    $$

2. List the number of atoms of different elements present in the unbalanced
   [equation (1.5)](#equation-1.5).

   <Table>
   | Element   | Number of atoms in reactants (LHS) | Number of atoms in products (RHS) |
   | --------- | ---------------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
   | $\ce{Fe}$ | 1                                  | 3                                 |
   | $\ce{H}$  | 2                                  | 2                                 |
   | $\ce{O}$  | 1                                  | 4                                 |
   </Table>

3. It is often convenient to start balancing with the compound that contains the
   maximum number of atoms. It may be a reactant or a product. In that compound,
   select the element which has the maximum number of atoms. Using these
   criteria, we select $\ce{Fe3O4}$ and the element oxygen in it. There are four
   oxygen atoms on the RHS and only one on the LHS.

   To balance the oxygen atoms -

   <Table>
   | Atoms of oxygen | In reactants      | In products         |
   | --------------- | ----------------- | ------------------- |
   | Initial         | 1 (in $\ce{H2O}$) | 4 (in $\ce{Fe3O4}$) |
   | To balance      | 1 × 4             | 4                   |
   </Table>

   To equalise the number of atoms, it must be remembered that we cannot alter
   the formulae of the compounds or elements involved in the reactions. For
   example, to balance oxygen atoms we can put coefficient '4' as $\ce{4H2O}$
   and not $\ce{H2O4}$ or $\ce{(H2O)4}$. Now the partly balanced equation
   becomes -

   $$
    \tag{1.6}
    \ce{
        \underset{
            (partly balanced equation)
        }{
            Fe + 4 H2O -> Fe3O4 + H2
        }
    }
    $$

4. $\ce{Fe}$ and $\ce{H}$ atoms are still not balanced. Pick any of these
   elements to proceed further. Let us balance hydrogen atoms in the partly
   balanced equation.

   To equalise the number of $\ce{H}$ atoms, make the number of molecules of
   hydrogen as four on the RHS.

   <Table>
   | Atoms of hydrogen | In reactants       | In products      |
   | ----------------- | ------------------ | ---------------- |
   | Initial           | 8 (in $\ce{4H2O}$) | 2 (in $\ce{H2}$) |
   | To balance        | 8                  | 2 × 4            |
    </Table>

   The equation would be - 
   
   $$
    \tag{1.7}
    \ce{
        \underset{
            (partly balanced equation)
        }{
            Fe + 4 H2O -> Fe3O4 + 4 H2
        }
    }
    $$

5. Examine the above equation and pick up the third element which is not
   balanced. You find that only one element is left to be balanced, that is,
   iron.

    <Table>
   | Atoms of iron | In reactants     | In products         |
   | ------------- | ---------------- | ------------------- |
   | Initial       | 1 (in $\ce{Fe}$) | 3 (in $\ce{Fe3O4}$) |
   | To balance    | 1 × 3            | 3                   |
    </Table>

   To equalise $\ce{Fe}$, we take three atoms of $\ce{Fe}$ on the LHS.

   $$
    \tag{1.8}
    \ce{3 Fe + 4 H2O -> Fe3O4 + 4 H2}
    $$

6. Finally, to check the correctness of the balanced equation, we count atoms of
   each element on both sides of the equation.

   $$
    \tag{1.9}
    \ce{\underset{
            (balanced equation)
        }{
            3 Fe + 4 H2O -> Fe3O4 + 4 H2
        }
    }
    $$

   The numbers of atoms of elements on both sides of [Eq. (1.9)](#equation-1.9) are equal. This
   equation is now balanced. This method of balancing chemical equations is
   called hit-and-trial method as we make trials to balance the equation by
   using the smallest whole number coefficient.

7. Writing Symbols of Physical States Carefully examine the above balanced [Eq.
   (1.9)](#equation-1.9). Does this equation tell us anything about the physical state of each
   reactant and product? No information has been given in this equation about
   their physical states.

   To make a chemical equation more informative, the physical states of the
   reactants and products are mentioned along with their chemical formulae. The
   gaseous, liquid, aqueous and solid states of reactants and products are
   represented by the notations (g), (l), (aq) and (s), respectively. The word
   aqueous (aq) is written if the reactant or product is present as a solution
   in water.

   The balanced [Eq. (1.9)](#equatiopn-1.9) becomes

   $$
    \tag{1.10}
    \ce{3 Fe(s) + 4 H2O(g) -> Fe3O4(s) + 4 H2(g)}
    $$

   Note that the symbol (g) is used with $\ce{H2O}$ to indicate that in this
   reaction water is used in the form of steam.

   Usually physical states are not included in a chemical equation unless it is
   necessary to specify them.

   Sometimes the reaction conditions, such as temperature, pressure, catalyst,
   etc., for the reaction are indicated above and/or below the arrow in the
   equation. For example -

   $$
    \tag{1.11}
    \ce{CO(g) + 2 H2(g) ->[340atm] CH3OH(l)}
    $$

   $$
    \tag{1.12}
    \ce{
        6 CO2(aq) + 12 H2O(l)
        ->[Chlorophyll][Sunlight]
        \underset{(Gluecose)}{C6H12O6(aq)} + 6 O2(aq) + 6 H2O(l)
    }
    $$

</Steps>

Using these steps, can you balance [Eq. (1.2)](#equation-1.2) given in the text earlier?

## 1.2 TYPES OF CHEMICAL REACTIONS

We have learnt in Class IX that during a chemical reaction atoms of one element
do not change into those of another element. Nor do atoms disappear from the
mixture or appear from elsewhere. Actually, chemical reactions involve the
breaking and making of bonds between atoms to produce new substances. You will
study about types of bonds formed between atoms in Chapters 3 and 4.

### 1.2.1 Combination Reaction

<Activity id="1.4" title="Activity 1.4">
- Take a small amount of calcium oxide or quick lime in a beaker.
- Slowly add water to this.
- Touch the beaker as shown in [Fig. 1.3](#figure-1.3).
- Do you feel any change in temperature?
</Activity>

<Figure
  id="1.3"
  title="Figure 1.3: Formation of slaked lime by the reaction of calcium oxide with water"
/>

Calcium oxide reacts vigorously with water to produce slaked lime (calcium
hydroxide) releasing a large amount of heat.

$$ 
\tag{1.13} \ce{

    \underset{(Quick lime)}{CaO(s)} + H2O(l)
    ->
    \underset{(Slaked lime)}{Ca(OH)2(aq)} + Heat

} 
$$

In this reaction, calcium oxide and water combine to form a single product,
calcium hydroxide. Such a reaction in which a single product is formed from two
or more reactants is known as a combination reaction.

<Know title="Do You Know?">
A solution of slaked lime produced by the reaction [1.13](#equation-1.13) is used for whitewashing
walls. Calcium hydroxide reacts slowly with the carbon dioxide in air to form a
thin layer of calcium carbonate on the walls. Calcium carbonate is formed after
two to three days of whitewashing and gives a shiny finish to the walls. It is
interesting to note that the chemical formula for marble is also $\ce{CaCO3}$.

$$ 
\tag{1.14} \ce{

    \underset{(Calcium hydroxide)}{Ca(OH)2(aq)} + CO2(g)
    ->
    \underset{(Calcium  carbonate)}{CaCO3(s)} + H2O(l)

} 
$$
</Know>

Let us discuss some more examples of combination reactions.

- (i) Burning of coal

$$
\tag{1.15}
\ce{C(s) + O2(g) -> CO2(g)}
$$

- (ii) Formation of water from $\ce{H2(g)}$ and $\ce{O2(g)}$

$$
\tag{1.16}
\ce{2 H2(g) + O2(g) -> 2 H2O(l)}
$$

In simple language we can say that when two or more substances (elements or
compounds) combine to form a single product, the reactions are called
combination reactions.

In [Activity 1.4](#activity-1.4), we also observed that a large amount of heat is evolved. This
makes the reaction mixture warm. Reactions in which heat is released along with
the formation of products are called exothermic chemical reactions.

Other examples of exothermic reactions are -

- (i) Burning of natural gas

$$
\tag{1.17}
\ce{CH4(g) + 2 O2(g) -> CO2(g) + 2 H2O(g)}
$$

- (ii) Do you know that respiration is an exothermic process?

We all know that we need energy to stay alive. We get this energy from the food
we eat. During digestion, food is broken down into simpler substances. For
example, rice, potatoes and bread contain carbohydrates. These carbohydrates are
broken down to form glucose. This glucose combines with oxygen in the cells of
our body and provides energy. The special name of this reaction is respiration,
the process of which you will study in Chapter 6.

$$ 
\tag{1.18} \ce{

    \underset{(Glucose)}{C6H12O6(aq)} + 6 O2(aq)
    -> 6
    CO2(aq) + 6 H2O(l) + \text{energy}

} 
$$

- (iii) The decomposition of vegetable matter into compost is also an example of
  an exothermic reaction.

Identify the type of the reaction taking place in [Activity 1.1](#activity-1.1), where heat is
given out along with the formation of a single product.

### 1.2.2 Decomposition Reaction

<Activity id="1.5" title="Activity 1.5">
- Take about $2g$ ferrous sulphate crystals in a dry boiling tube.
- Note the colour of the ferrous sulphate crystals.
- Heat the boiling tube over the flame of a burner or spirit lamp as shown in
  [Fig. 1.4](#figure-1.4).
- Observe the colour of the crystals after heating.
</Activity>


<Figure 
  id="1.4" 
  title="Figure 1.4: Correct way of heating the boiling tube containing crystals of ferrous sulphate and of smelling the odour" 
/>

Have you noticed that the green colour of the ferrous sulphate crystals has
changed? You can also smell the characteristic odour of burning sulphur.

$$ 
\tag{1.19} \ce{

    \underset{(Ferrous sulphate)}{2 FeSO4(s)}
    ->[\text{Heat}]
    \underset{(Ferric oxide)}{Fe2O3(s)} + SO2(g) + SO3(g)

}
$$

In this reaction you can observe that a single reactant breaks down to give
simpler products. This is a decomposition reaction. Ferrous sulphate crystals
($\ce{FeSO4.7H2O}$) lose water when heated and the colour of the crystals
changes. It then decomposes to ferric oxide ($\ce{Fe2O3}$), sulphur dioxide
($\ce{SO2}$) and sulphur trioxide ($\ce{SO3}$). Ferric oxide is a solid, while
$\ce{SO2}$ and $\ce{SO3}$ are gases.

Decomposition of calcium carbonate to calcium oxide and carbon dioxide on
heating is an important decomposition reaction used in various industries.
Calcium oxide is called lime or quick lime. It has many uses - one is in the
manufacture of cement. When a decomposition reaction is carried out by heating,
it is called thermal decomposition.

$$ 
\tag{1.20} \ce{

    \underset{(Limestone)}{CaCO3(s)}
    ->[\text{Heat}]
    \underset{(Quick lime) }{CaO(s)} + CO2(g)

}
$$

Another example of a thermal decomposition reaction is given in [Activity 1.6](#activity-1.6).

<Activity id="1.6" title="Activity 1.6">
- Take about $2g$ lead nitrate powder in a boiling tube.
- Hold the boiling tube with a pair of tongs and heat it over a flame, as shown
  in [Fig. 1.5](#figure-1.5).
- What do you observe? Note down the change, if any.
</Activity>

<Figure id="1.5" title="Figure 1.5: Heating of lead nitrate and emission of nitrogen dioxide" />

You will observe the emission of brown fumes. These fumes are of nitrogen
dioxide ($\ce{NO2}$). The reaction that takes place is -

$$ 
\tag{1.21} \ce{

    \underset{(Lead nitrate)}{2 Pb(NO3)2(s)}
    ->[\text{Heat}]
    \underset{(Lead oxide)}{2 PbO(s)} +
    \underset{(Nitrogen dioxide)}{4 NO2(g)} +
    \underset{(Oxygen)}{O2(g)}

} 
$$

Let us perform some more decomposition reactions as given in [Activities 1.7](#activity-1.7) and
[1.8](#activity-1.8).

<Activity id="1.7" title="Activity 1.7">
- Take a plastic mug. Drill two holes at its base and fit rubber stoppers in
  these holes. Insert carbon electrodes in these rubber stoppers as shown in
  [Fig. 1.6](#figure-1.6).
- Connect these electrodes to a $6 \text{volt}$ battery.
- Fill the mug with water such that the electrodes are immersed. Add a few drops
  of dilute sulphuric acid to the water.
- Take two test tubes filled with water and invert them over the two carbon
  electrodes.
- Switch on the current and leave the apparatus undisturbed for some time.
- You will observe the formation of bubbles at both the electrodes. These
  bubbles displace water in the test tubes.
- Is the volume of the gas collected the same in both the test tubes?
- Once the test tubes are filled with the respective gases, remove them
  carefully.
- Test these gases one by one by bringing a burning candle close to the mouth of
  the test tubes. 
  <Aside type="danger" title="CAUTION">
    This step must be performed carefully by the teacher.
  </Aside>
- What happens in each case?
- Which gas is present in each test tube?
</Activity>

<Figure id="1.6" title="Figure 1.6: Electrolysis of water" />

<Activity id="1.8" title="Activity 1.8">
- Take about $2g$ silver chloride in a china dish.
- What is its colour?
- Place this china dish in sunlight for some time ([Fig. 1.7](#figure-1.7)).
- Observe the colour of the silver chloride after some time.
</Activity>

<Figure id="1.7" title="Figure 1.7: Silver chloride turns grey sunlight to form silver metal" />

You will see that white silver chloride turns grey in sunlight. This is due to
the decomposition of silver chloride into silver and chlorine by in light.

$$ 
\tag{1.22} 
\ce{
    2 AgCl(s) ->[\text{Sunlight}] 2 Ag(s) + Cl2(g)
} 
$$

Silver bromide also behaves in the same way.

$$ 
\tag{1.23} \ce{

    2 AgBr(s) ->[\text{Sunlight}] 2 Ag(s) + Br2(g)

} 
$$

The above reactions are used in black and white photography. What form of energy
is causing these decomposition reactions?

We have seen that the decomposition reactions require energy either in the form
of heat, light or electricity for breaking down the reactants. Reactions in
which energy is absorbed are known as endothermic reactions.

<Activity title="Carry out the following Activity">
Take about $2g$ barium hydroxide in a test tube. Add $1g$ of ammonium chloride
and mix with the help of a glass rod. Touch the bottom of the test tube with
your palm. What do you feel? Is this an exothermic or endothermic reaction?
</Activity>

## QUESTIONS

1. A solution of a substance 'X' is used for whitewashing.
   - (i) Name the substance 'X' and write its formula.
   - (ii) Write the reaction of the substance 'X' named in (i) above with water.
2. Why is the amount of gas collected in one of the test tubes in [Activity 1.7](#activity-1.7)
   double of the amount collected in the other? Name this gas.

### 1.2.3 Displacement Reaction

<Activity id="1.9" title="Activity 1.9">
- Take three iron nails and clean them by rubbing with sand paper.
- Take two test tubes marked as (A) and (B). In each test tube, take about $10ml$
  copper sulphate solution.
- Tie two iron nails with a thread and immerse them carefully in the copper
  sulphate solution in test tube B for about 20 minutes [[Fig. 1.8 (a)](#figure-1.8.a)]. Keep one
  iron nail aside for comparison.
- After 20 minutes, take out the iron nails from the copper sulphate solution.
- Compare the intensity of the blue colour of copper sulphate solutions in test
  tubes (A) and (B) [[Fig. 1.8 (b)](#figure-1.8.b)].
- Also, compare the colour of the iron nails dipped in the copper sulphate
  solution with the one kept aside [[Fig. 1.8 (b)](#figure-1.8.b)].
</Activity>

<Figure id="1.8.a" title="Figure 1.8: (a) Iron nails dipped in copper sulphate solution" />

<Figure id="1.8.b" title="Figure 1.8: (b) Iron nails and copper sulphate solutions compared before and after the experiment" />

Why does the iron nail become brownish in colour and the blue colour of copper
sulphate solution fades?

The following chemical reaction takes place in this Activity-

$$ 
\tag{1.24} \ce{

    Fe(s) + \underset{(Copper sulphate)}{CuSO4(aq)}
    ->
    \underset{(Iron sulphate)}{FeSO4(aq)} + Cu(s)

}
$$

In this reaction, iron has displaced or removed another element, copper, from
copper sulphate solution. This reaction is known as displacement reaction.

Other examples of displacement reactions are

$$ 
\tag{1.25} 
\ce{
    Zn(s) + \underset{(Copper sulphate)}{CuSO4(aq)}
    ->
    \underset{(Zinc sulphate)}{ZnSO4(aq)} + Cu(s)
}
$$

$$ 
\tag{1.26} 
\ce{
    Pb(s) + \underset{(Copper chloride)}{CuCl2(aq)}
    ->
    \underset{(Lead chloride)}{PbCl2(aq)} + Cu(s)
} 
$$

Zinc and lead are more reactive elements than copper. They displace copper from
its compounds.

### 1.2.4 Double Displacement Reaction

<Activity id="1.10" title="Activity 1.10">
- Take about $3ml$ of sodium sulphate solution in a test tube.
- In another test tube, take about $3ml$ of barium chloride solution.
- Mix the two solutions ([Fig. 1.9](#figure-1.9)).
- What do you observe?
</Activity>

<Figure id="1.9" title="Figure 1.9: Formation of barium sulphate and sodium chloride" />

You will observe that a white substance, which is insoluble in water, is formed.
This insoluble substance formed is known as a precipitate. Any reaction that
produces a precipitate can be called a precipitation reaction.

$$ 
\tag{1.27} 
\ce{
    \underset{(Sodium sulphate)}{Na2SO4(aq)} +
    \underset{(Barium Chloride)}{BaCl2(aq)}
    ->
    \underset{(Barium Sulphate)}{BaSO4(s)} +
    \underset{(Sodium Chloride)}{2 NaCl(aq)}
} 
$$

What causes this? The white precipitate of $\ce{BaSO4}$ is formed by the
reaction of $\ce{SO^{2-}_{4}}$ and $\ce{Ba^{2+}}$. The other product formed is
sodium chloride which remains in the solution. Such reactions in which there is
an exchange of ions between the reactants are called double displacement
reactions.

Recall [Activity 1.2](#activity-1.2), where you have mixed the solutions of lead(II) nitrate and
potassium iodide.

- (i) What was the colour of the precipitate formed? Can you name the compound
  precipitated?
- (ii) Write the balanced chemical equation for this reaction.
- (iii) Is this also a double displacement reaction?

### 1.2.5 Oxidation and Reduction

<Activity id="1.11" title="Activity 1.11">
- Heat a china dish containing about $1g$ copper powder ([Fig. 1.10](#activity-1.10)).
- What do you observe?
</Activity>

<Figure id="1.10" title="Figure 1.10: Oxidation of copper to copper oxide" />

The surface of copper powder becomes coated with black copper(II) oxide. Why has
this black substance formed?

This is because oxygen is added to copper and copper oxide is formed.

$$
\tag{1.28}
\ce{2Cu + O2 ->[Heat] 2CuO}
$$

If hydrogen gas is passed over this heated material ($\ce{CuO}$), the black
coating on the surface turns brown as the reverse reaction takes place and
copper is obtained.

$$
\tag{1.29}
\ce{CuO + H2 ->[Heat] Cu + H2O}
$$

If a substance gains oxygen during a reaction, it is said to be oxidised. If a
substance loses oxygen during a reaction, it is said to be reduced.

During this reaction ([1.29](#equation-1.29)), the copper(II) oxide is losing oxygen and is being
reduced. The hydrogen is gaining oxygen and is being oxidised. In other words,
one reactant gets oxidised while the other gets reduced during a reaction. Such
reactions are called oxidation-reduction reactions or redox reactions.

$$
\tag{1.30}
\rlap{$\underbrace{\phantom{\ce{CuO + H2 ->[Heat] Cu}}}_{\text{Reduction}}$}
\ce{CuO +} \overbrace{\ce{H2 ->[Heat] Cu + H2O}}^{\text{Oxidation}}
$$

Some other examples of redox reactions are:

$$ 
\tag{1.31} 
\ce{
    ZnO + C -> Zn + CO
} 
$$

$$ 
\tag{1.32} 
\ce{
    MnO2 + 4 HCl -> MnCl2 + 2 H2O + Cl2
} 
$$

In reaction ([1.31](#equation-1.31)) carbon is oxidised to $\ce{CO}$ and $\ce{ZnO}$ is reduced to
$\ce{Zn}$. In reaction ([1.32](#equation-1.32)) $\ce{HCl}$ is oxidised to $\ce{Cl2}$ whereas
$\ce{MnO2}$ is reduced to $\ce{MnCl2}$.

From the above examples we can say that if a substance gains oxygen or loses
hydrogen during a reaction, it is oxidised. If a substance loses oxygen or gains
hydrogen during a reaction, it is reduced.

Recall [Activity 1.1](#activity-1.1), where a magnesium ribbon burns with a dazzling flame in air
(oxygen) and changes into a white substance, magnesium oxide. Is magnesium being
oxidised or reduced in this reaction?

## 1.3 HAVE YOU OBSERVED THE EFFECTS OF OXIDATION REACTIONS IN EVERYDAY LIFE?

### 1.3.1 Corrosion

You must have observed that iron articles are shiny when new, but get coated
with a reddish brown powder when left for some time. This process is commonly
known as rusting of iron. Some other metals also get tarnished in this manner.
Have you noticed the colour of the coating formed on copper and silver? When a
metal is attacked by substances around it such as moisture, acids, etc., it is
said to corrode and this process is called corrosion. The black coating on
silver and the green coating on copper are other examples of corrosion.

Corrosion causes damage to car bodies, bridges, iron railings, ships and to all
objects made of metals, specially those of iron. Corrosion of iron is a serious
problem. Every year an enormous amount of money is spent to replace damaged
iron. You will learn more about corrosion in Chapter 3.

### 1.3.2 Rancidity

Have you ever tasted or smelt the fat/oil containing food materials left for a
long time?

When fats and oils are oxidised, they become rancid and their smell and taste
change. Usually substances which prevent oxidation (antioxidants) are added to
foods containing fats and oil. Keeping food in air tight containers helps to
slow down oxidation. Do you know that chips manufacturers usually flush bags of
chips with gas such as nitrogen to prevent the chips from getting oxidised ?

## QUESTIONS

1. Why does the colour of copper sulphate solution change when an iron nail is
   dipped in it?
2. Give an example of a double displacement reaction other than the one given in
   [Activity 1.10](#activity-1.10).
3. Identify the substances that are oxidised and the substances that are reduced
   in the following reactions.
   - (i) $\ce{4 Na(s) + O2(g) -> 2 Na2O(s)}$
   - (ii) $\ce{CuO(s) + H2(g) -> Cu(s) + H2O(l)}$

## What you have learnt

<Summary>
- A complete chemical equation represents the reactants, products and their
  physical states symbolically.
- A chemical equation is balanced so that the numbers of atoms of each type
  involved in a chemical reaction are the same on the reactant and product sides
  of the equation. Equations must always be balanced.
- In a combination reaction two or more substances combine to form a new single
  substance.
- Decomposition reactions are opposite to combination reactions. In a
  decomposition reaction, a single substance decomposes to give two or more
  substances.
- Reactions in which heat is given out along with the products are called
  exothermic reactions.
- Reactions in which energy is absorbed are known as endothermic reactions.
  nWhen an element displaces another element from its compound, a displacement
  reaction occurs.
- Two different atoms or groups of atoms (ions) are exchanged in double
  displacement reactions.
- Precipitation reactions produce insoluble salts.
- Reactions also involve the gain or loss of oxygen or hydrogen by substances.
  Oxidation is the gain of oxygen or loss of hydrogen. Reduction is the loss of
  oxygen or gain of hydrogen.
