## 5 On The Face Of It

### SCENE ONE

Mr Lamb's garden [There is the occasional sound of birdsong and of tree leaves
rustling. Derry's footsteps are heard as he walks slowly and tentatively through
the long grass. He pauses, then walks on again. He comes round a screen of
bushes, so that when Mr Lamb speaks to him he is close at hand and Derry is
startled]

<Think title="Read and dind Out">
How does Derry Who is Mr Lamb? get into his garden?
</Think>


<Dialogue speaker="MR LAMB">
 Mind the apples!

</Dialogue>

<Dialogue speaker="DERRY">
What? Who's that? Who's there?
</Dialogue>

<Dialogue speaker="MR LAMB">
Lamb's my name. Mind the apples. Crab apples those are. Windfalls in
the long grass. You could trip.
</Dialogue>

<Dialogue speaker="DERRY">
I....there....I thought this was an empty place. I didn't know there was
anybody here....
</Dialogue>

<Dialogue speaker="MR LAMB">
 That's all right. I'm here. What are you afraid of, boy? That's all
right.
</Dialogue>

<Dialogue speaker="DERRY">
I thought it was empty....an empty house.
</Dialogue>

<Dialogue speaker="MR LAMB">
 So it is. Since I'm out here in the garden. It is empty. Until I go
back inside. In the meantime, I'm out here and likely to stop. A day like this.
Beautiful day. Not a day to be indoors.
</Dialogue>

<Dialogue speaker="DERRY">
[Panic] I've got to go.
</Dialogue>

<Dialogue speaker="MR LAMB">
Not on my account. I don't mind who comes into the garden. The gate's
always open. Only you climbed the garden wall.
</Dialogue>

<Dialogue speaker="DERRY">
[Angry] You were watching me.
</Dialogue>

<Dialogue speaker="MR LAMB">
I saw you. But the gate's open. All welcome. You're welcome. I sit
here. I like sitting.
</Dialogue>

<Dialogue speaker="DERRY">
I'd not come to steal anything.
</Dialogue>

<Dialogue speaker="MR LAMB">
 No, no. The young lads steal....scrump the apples. You're not so young.
</Dialogue>

<Dialogue speaker="DERRY">
I just....wanted to come in. Into the garden.
</Dialogue>

<Dialogue speaker="MR LAMB">
 So you did. Here we are, then.
</Dialogue>

<Dialogue speaker="DERRY">
You don't know who I am.
</Dialogue>

<Dialogue speaker="MR LAMB">
 A boy. Thirteen or so.
</Dialogue>

<Dialogue speaker="DERRY">
Fourteen. [Pause] But I've got to go now. Good-bye.
</Dialogue>

<Dialogue speaker="MR LAMB">
Nothing to be afraid of. Just a garden. Just me.
</Dialogue>

<Dialogue speaker="DERRY">
But I'm not....I'm not afraid. [Pause] People are afraid of me.
</Dialogue>

<Dialogue speaker="MR LAMB">
Why should that be?
</Dialogue>

<Dialogue speaker="DERRY">
Everyone is. It doesn't matter who they are, or what they say, or how
they look. How they pretend. I know. I can see.
</Dialogue>

<Dialogue speaker="MR LAMB">
See what?
</Dialogue>

<Dialogue speaker="DERRY">
What they think.
</Dialogue>

<Dialogue speaker="MR LAMB">
What do they think, then?
</Dialogue>

<Dialogue speaker="DERRY">
You think.... 'Here's a boy.' You look at me...and then you see my face
and you think. 'That's bad. That's a terrible thing. That's the ugliest thing I
ever saw.' You think, 'Poor boy.' But I'm not. Not poor. Underneath, you are
afraid. Anybody would be. I am. When I look in the mirror, and see it, I'm
afraid of me. On the Face of It
</Dialogue>

<Dialogue speaker="MR LAMB">
No, Not the whole of you. Not of you.
</Dialogue>

<Dialogue speaker="DERRY">
Yes!
</Dialogue>

[Pause]

<Dialogue speaker="MR LAMB">
Later on, when it's a bit cooler, I'll get the ladder and a stick, and
pull down those crab apples. They're ripe for it. I make jelly. It's a good time
of year, September. Look at them....orange and golden. That's magic fruit. I
often say. But it's best picked and made into jelly. You could give me a hand.
</Dialogue>

<Dialogue speaker="DERRY">
What have you changed the subject for? People always do that. Why don't
you ask me? Why do you do what they all do and pretend it isn't true and isn't
there? In case I see you looking and mind and get upset? I'll tell....you don't
ask me because you're afraid to.
</Dialogue>

<Dialogue speaker="MR LAMB">
You want me to ask....say so, then.
</Dialogue>

<Dialogue speaker="DERRY">
I don't like being with people. Any people.
</Dialogue>

<Dialogue speaker="MR LAMB">
I should say....to look at it.... I should say, you got burned in a
fire.
</Dialogue>

<Dialogue speaker="DERRY">
Not in a fire. I got acid all down that side of my face and it burned it
all away. It ate my face up. It ate me up. And now it's like this and it won't
ever be any different.
</Dialogue>

/>

<Dialogue speaker="MR LAMB">
No.
</Dialogue>

<Dialogue speaker="DERRY">
Aren't you interested?
</Dialogue>

<Dialogue speaker="MR LAMB">
You're a boy who came into the garden. Plenty do. I'm interested in
anybody. Anything. There's nothing God made that doesn't interest me. Look over
there....over beside the far wall. What can you see?
</Dialogue>

<Dialogue speaker="DERRY">
Rubbish.
</Dialogue>

<Dialogue speaker="MR LAMB">
Rubbish ? Look, boy, look....what do you see?
</Dialogue>

<Dialogue speaker="DERRY">
Just....grass and stuff. Weeds.
</Dialogue>

<Dialogue speaker="MR LAMB">
Some call them weeds. If you like, then....a weed garden, that. There's
fruit and there are flowers, and trees and herbs. All sorts. But over
there....weeds. I grow weeds there. Why is one green, growing plant called a
weed and another 'flower'? Where's the difference. It's all life.... growing.
Same as you and me.
</Dialogue>

<Dialogue speaker="DERRY">
We're not the same.
</Dialogue>

<Dialogue speaker="MR LAMB">
I'm old. You're young. You've got a burned face, I've got a tin leg.
Not important. You're standing there.... I'm sitting here. Where's the
difference?
</Dialogue>

<Dialogue speaker="DERRY">
Why have you got a tin leg?
</Dialogue>

<Dialogue speaker="MR LAMB">
Real one got blown off, years back. Lamey-Lamb, some kids say. Haven't
you heard them? You will. Lamey-Lamb. It fits. Doesn't trouble me.
</Dialogue>

<Dialogue speaker="DERRY">
But you can put on trousers and cover it up and no one sees, they don't
have to notice and stare.
</Dialogue>

<Dialogue speaker="MR LAMB">
Some do. Some don't. They get tired of it, in the end. There's plenty
of other things to stare at.
</Dialogue>

<Dialogue speaker="DERRY">
Like my face.
</Dialogue>

<Dialogue speaker="MR LAMB">
Like crab apples or the weeds or a spider climbing up a silken ladder,
or my tall sun-flowers.
</Dialogue>

<Dialogue speaker="DERRY">
Things.
</Dialogue>

<Dialogue speaker="MR LAMB">
It's all relative. Beauty and the beast.
</Dialogue>

<Dialogue speaker="DERRY">
What's that supposed to mean?
</Dialogue>

<Dialogue speaker="MR LAMB">
You tell me.
</Dialogue>

<Dialogue speaker="DERRY">
You needn't think they haven't all told me that fairy story before. 'It's
not what you look like, it's what you are inside. Handsome is as handsome does.
Beauty loved the monstrous beast for himself and when she kissed him he changed
into a handsome prince.' Only he wouldn't, he'd have stayed a monstrous beast. I
won't change.
</Dialogue>

<Dialogue speaker="MR LAMB">
In that way? No, you won't.
</Dialogue>

<Dialogue speaker="DERRY">
And no one'll kiss me, ever. Only my mother, and she kisses me on the
other side of my face, and I don't like my mother to kiss me, she does it
because she has to. Why should I like that? I don't care if nobody ever kisses
me.
</Dialogue>

<Dialogue speaker="MR LAMB">
Ah, but do you care if you never kiss them.
</Dialogue>

<Dialogue speaker="DERRY">
What?
</Dialogue>

<Dialogue speaker="MR LAMB">
Girls. Pretty girls. Long hair and large eyes. People you love.
</Dialogue>

<Dialogue speaker="DERRY">
Who'd let me? Not one.
</Dialogue>

<Dialogue speaker="MR LAMB">
Who can tell?
</Dialogue>

<Dialogue speaker="DERRY">
I won't ever look different. When I'm as old as you, I'll look the same.
I'll still only have half a face.
</Dialogue>

<Dialogue speaker="MR LAMB">
So you will. But the world won't. The world's got a whole face, and the
world's there to be looked at.
</Dialogue>

<Dialogue speaker="DERRY">
Do you think this is the world? This old garden?
</Dialogue>

<Dialogue speaker="MR LAMB">
 When I'm here. Not the only one. But the world, as much as anywhere.
</Dialogue>

<Dialogue speaker="DERRY">
Does your leg hurt you?
</Dialogue>

<Dialogue speaker="MR LAMB">
Tin doesn't hurt, boy!
</Dialogue>

<Dialogue speaker="DERRY">
When it came off, did it?
</Dialogue>

<Dialogue speaker="MR LAMB">
Certainly.
</Dialogue>

<Dialogue speaker="DERRY">
And now? I mean, where the tin stops, at the top?
</Dialogue>

<Dialogue speaker="MR LAMB">
Now and then. In wet weather. It doesn't signify.
</Dialogue>

<Dialogue speaker="DERRY">
Oh, that's something else they all say. 'Look at all those people who are
in pain and brave and never cry and never complain and don't feel sorry for
themselves.'
</Dialogue>

<Dialogue speaker="MR LAMB">
I haven't said it.
</Dialogue>

<Dialogue speaker="DERRY">
And think of all those people worse off than you. Think, you might have
been blinded, or born deaf, or have to live in a wheelchair, or be daft in your
head and dribble.
</Dialogue>

<Dialogue speaker="MR LAMB">
And that's all true, and you know it.
</Dialogue>

<Dialogue speaker="DERRY">
It won't make my face change. Do you know, one day, a woman went by me in
the street — I was at a bus-stop — and she was with another woman, and she
looked at me, and she said.... whispered....only I heard her.... she said, "Look
at that, that's a terrible thing. That's a face only a mother could love."
</Dialogue>

<Dialogue speaker="MR LAMB">
So you believe everything you hear, then?
</Dialogue>

<Dialogue speaker="DERRY">
It was cruel.
</Dialogue>

<Dialogue speaker="MR LAMB">
Maybe not meant as such. Just something said between them.
</Dialogue>

<Dialogue speaker="DERRY">
Only I heard it. I heard.
</Dialogue>

<Dialogue speaker="MR LAMB">
And is that the only thing you ever heard anyone say, in your life?
</Dialogue>

<Dialogue speaker="DERRY">
Oh no! I've heard a lot of things.
</Dialogue>

<Dialogue speaker="MR LAMB">
So now you keep your ears shut.
</Dialogue>

<Dialogue speaker="DERRY">
You're....peculiar. You say peculiar things. You ask questions I don't
understand.
</Dialogue>

<Dialogue speaker="MR LAMB">
I like to talk. Have company. You don't have to answer questions. You
don't have to stop here at all. The gate's open.
</Dialogue>

<Dialogue speaker="DERRY">
Yes, but...
</Dialogue>

<Dialogue speaker="MR LAMB">
I've a hive of bees behind those trees over there. Some hear bees and
they say, bees buzz. But when you listen to bees for a long while, they
humm....and hum means 'sing'. I hear them singing, my bees.
</Dialogue>

<Dialogue speaker="DERRY">
But....I like it here. I came in because I liked it....when I looked over
the wall.
</Dialogue>

<Dialogue speaker="MR LAMB">
If you'd seen me, you'd not have come in.
</Dialogue>

<Dialogue speaker="DERRY">
No.
</Dialogue>

<Dialogue speaker="MR LAMB">
No.
</Dialogue>

<Dialogue speaker="DERRY">
It'd have been trespassing.
</Dialogue>

<Dialogue speaker="MR LAMB">
Ah. That's not why.
</Dialogue>

<Dialogue speaker="DERRY">
I don't like being near people. When they stare....when I see them being
afraid of me.
</Dialogue>

<Dialogue speaker="MR LAMB">
You could lock yourself up in a room and never leave it. There was a
man who did that. He was afraid, you see. Of everything. Everything in this
world. A bus might run him over, or a man might breathe deadly germs onto him,
or a donkey might kick him to death, or lightning might strike him down, or he
might love a girl and the girl would leave him, and he might slip on a banana
skin and fall and people who saw him would laugh their heads off. So he went
into this room, and locked the door, and got into his bed, and stayed there.
</Dialogue>

<Dialogue speaker="DERRY">
For ever?
</Dialogue>

<Dialogue speaker="MR LAMB">
For a while.
</Dialogue>

<Dialogue speaker="DERRY">
Then what?
</Dialogue>

<Dialogue speaker="MR LAMB">
A picture fell off the wall on to his head and killed him. [Derry
laughs a lot]
</Dialogue>

<Think title="Read and find Out">
Do you think all this will change Derry's attitude towards Mr Lamb?
</Think>


<Dialogue speaker="MR LAMB">
You see?
</Dialogue>

<Dialogue speaker="DERRY">
But....you still say peculiar things.
</Dialogue>

<Dialogue speaker="MR LAMB">
Peculiar to some.
</Dialogue>

<Dialogue speaker="DERRY">
What do you do all day?
</Dialogue>

<Dialogue speaker="MR LAMB">
Sit in the sun. Read books. Ah, you thought it was an empty house, but
inside, it's full. Books and other things. Full.
</Dialogue>

<Dialogue speaker="DERRY">
But there aren't any curtains at the windows.
</Dialogue>

<Dialogue speaker="MR LAMB">
I'm not fond of curtains. Shutting things out, shutting things in. I
like the light and the darkness, and the windows open, to hear the wind.
</Dialogue>

<Dialogue speaker="DERRY">
Yes. I like that. When it's raining, I like to hear it on the roof.
</Dialogue>

<Dialogue speaker="MR LAMB">
So you're not lost, are you? Not altogether? You do hear things. You
listen.
</Dialogue>

<Dialogue speaker="DERRY">
They talk about me. Downstairs, When I'm not there. 'What'll he ever do?
What's going to happen to him when we've gone? How ever will he get on in this
world? Looking like that? With that on his face?' That's what they say.
</Dialogue>

<Dialogue speaker="MR LAMB">
Lord, boy, you've got two arms, two legs and eyes and ears, you've got
a tongue and a brain. You'll get on the way you want, like all the rest. And if
you chose, and set your mind to it, you could get on better than all the rest.
</Dialogue>

<Dialogue speaker="DERRY">
How?
</Dialogue>

<Dialogue speaker="MR LAMB">
Same way as I do.
</Dialogue>

<Dialogue speaker="DERRY">
Do you have any friends?
</Dialogue>

<Dialogue speaker="MR LAMB">
Hundreds.
</Dialogue>

<Dialogue speaker="DERRY">
But you live by yourself in that house. It's a big house, too.
</Dialogue>

<Dialogue speaker="MR LAMB">
Friends everywhere. People come in.... everybody knows me. The gate's
always open. They come and sit here. And in front of the fire in winter. Kids
come for the apples and pears. And for toffee. I make toffee with honey. Anybody
comes. So have you.
</Dialogue>

<Dialogue speaker="DERRY">
But I'm not a friend.
</Dialogue>

<Dialogue speaker="MR LAMB">
Certainly you are. So far as I'm concerned. What have you done to make
me think you're not?
</Dialogue>

<Dialogue speaker="DERRY">
You don't know me. You don't know where I come from or even what my name
is.
</Dialogue>

<Dialogue speaker="MR LAMB">
Why should that signify? Do I have to write all your particulars down
and put them in a filing box, before you can be a friend?
</Dialogue>

<Dialogue speaker="DERRY">
I suppose...not. No.
</Dialogue>

<Dialogue speaker="MR LAMB">
You could tell me your name. If you chose. And not, if you didn't.
</Dialogue>

<Dialogue speaker="DERRY">
Derry. Only it's Derek....but I hate that. Derry. If I'm your friend, you
don't have to be mine. I choose that.
</Dialogue>

<Dialogue speaker="MR LAMB">
Certainly.
</Dialogue>

<Dialogue speaker="DERRY">
I might never come here again, you might never see me again and then I
couldn't still be a friend.
</Dialogue>

<Dialogue speaker="MR LAMB">
Why not?
</Dialogue>

<Dialogue speaker="DERRY">
How could I? You pass people in the street and you might even speak to
them, but you never see them again. It doesn't mean they're friends.
</Dialogue>

<Dialogue speaker="MR LAMB">
Doesn't mean they're enemies, either, does it?
</Dialogue>

<Dialogue speaker="DERRY">
No they're just....nothing. People. That's all.
</Dialogue>

<Dialogue speaker="MR LAMB">
People are never just nothing. Never.
</Dialogue>

<Dialogue speaker="DERRY">
There are some people I hate.
</Dialogue>

<Dialogue speaker="MR LAMB">
That'd do you more harm than any bottle of acid. Acid only burns your
face.
</Dialogue>

<Dialogue speaker="DERRY">
Only....
</Dialogue>

<Dialogue speaker="MR LAMB">
Like a bomb only blew up my leg. There's worse things can happen. You
can burn yourself away inside.
</Dialogue>

<Dialogue speaker="DERRY">
After I'd come home, one person said, "He'd have been better off stopping
in there. In the hospital. He'd be better off with others like himself." She
thinks blind people only ought to be with other blind people and idiot boys with
idiot boys.
</Dialogue>

<Dialogue speaker="MR LAMB">
And people with no legs altogether?
</Dialogue>

<Dialogue speaker="DERRY">
That's right.
</Dialogue>

<Dialogue speaker="MR LAMB">
What kind of a world would that be?
</Dialogue>

<Dialogue speaker="DERRY">
At least there'd be nobody to stare at you because you weren't like them.
</Dialogue>

<Dialogue speaker="MR LAMB">
So you think you're just the same as all the other people with burned
faces? Just by what you look like? Ah....everything's different. Everything's
the same, but everything is different. Itself.
</Dialogue>

<Dialogue speaker="DERRY">
How do you make all that out?
</Dialogue>

<Dialogue speaker="MR LAMB">
Watching. Listening. Thinking.
</Dialogue>

<Dialogue speaker="DERRY">
I'd like a place like this. A garden. I'd like a house with no curtains.
</Dialogue>

<Dialogue speaker="MR LAMB">
The gate's always open.
</Dialogue>

<Dialogue speaker="DERRY">
But this isn't mine.
</Dialogue>

<Dialogue speaker="MR LAMB">
Everything's yours if you want it. What's mine is anybody's.
</Dialogue>

<Dialogue speaker="DERRY">
So I could come here again? Even if you were out....I could come here.
</Dialogue>

<Dialogue speaker="MR LAMB">
Certainly. You might find others here, of course.
</Dialogue>

<Dialogue speaker="DERRY">
Oh....
</Dialogue>

<Dialogue speaker="MR LAMB">
Well, that needn't stop you, you needn't mind.
</Dialogue>

<Dialogue speaker="DERRY">
It'd stop them. They'd mind me. When they saw me here. They look at my
face and run.
</Dialogue>

<Dialogue speaker="MR LAMB">
They might. They might not. You'd have to take the risk. So would they.
</Dialogue>

<Dialogue speaker="DERRY">
No, you would. You might have me and lose all your other friends, because
nobody wants to stay near me if they can help it.
</Dialogue>

<Dialogue speaker="MR LAMB">
I've not moved.
</Dialogue>

<Dialogue speaker="DERRY">
No....
</Dialogue>

<Dialogue speaker="MR LAMB">
When I go down the street, the kids shout 'Lamey-Lamb.' But they still
come into the garden, into my house; it's a game. They're not afraid of me. Why
should they be? Because I'm not afraid of them, that's why not.
</Dialogue>

<Dialogue speaker="DERRY">
Did you get your leg blown off in the war?
</Dialogue>

<Dialogue speaker="MR LAMB">
Certainly.
</Dialogue>

<Dialogue speaker="DERRY">
How will you climb on a ladder and get the crab apples down, then?
</Dialogue>

<Dialogue speaker="MR LAMB">
Oh, there's a lot of things I've learned to do, and plenty of time for
it. Years. I take it steady.
</Dialogue>

<Dialogue speaker="DERRY">
If you fell and broke your neck, you could lie on the grass and die. If
you were on your own.
</Dialogue>

<Dialogue speaker="MR LAMB">
I could.
</Dialogue>

<Dialogue speaker="DERRY">
You said I could help you.
</Dialogue>

<Dialogue speaker="MR LAMB">
If you want to.
</Dialogue>

<Dialogue speaker="DERRY">
But my mother'll want to know where I am. It's three miles home, across
the fields. I'm fourteen. but they still want to know where I am.
</Dialogue>

<Dialogue speaker="MR LAMB">
People worry.
</Dialogue>

<Dialogue speaker="DERRY">
People fuss.
</Dialogue>

<Dialogue speaker="MR LAMB">
Go back and tell them.
</Dialogue>

<Dialogue speaker="DERRY">
It's three miles.
</Dialogue>

<Dialogue speaker="MR LAMB">
It's a fine evening. You've got legs.
</Dialogue>

<Dialogue speaker="DERRY">
Once I got home, they'd never let me come back.
</Dialogue>

<Dialogue speaker="MR LAMB">
Once you got home, you'd never let yourself come back.
</Dialogue>

<Dialogue speaker="DERRY">
You don't know....you don't know what I could do.
</Dialogue>

<Dialogue speaker="MR LAMB">
No. Only you know that.
</Dialogue>

<Dialogue speaker="DERRY">
If I chose....
</Dialogue>

<Dialogue speaker="MR LAMB">
Ah....if you chose. I don't know everything, boy. I can't tell you what
to do.
</Dialogue>

<Dialogue speaker="DERRY">
They tell me.
</Dialogue>

<Dialogue speaker="MR LAMB">
Do you have to agree?
</Dialogue>

<Dialogue speaker="DERRY">
I don't know what I want. I want....something no one else has got or ever
will have. Something just mine. Like this garden. I don't know what it is.
</Dialogue>

<Dialogue speaker="MR LAMB">
You could find out.
</Dialogue>

<Dialogue speaker="DERRY">
How?
</Dialogue>

<Dialogue speaker="MR LAMB">
Waiting. Watching. Listening. Sitting here or going there. I'll have to
see to the bees.
</Dialogue>

<Dialogue speaker="DERRY">
Those other people who come here....do they talk to you? Ask you things?
</Dialogue>

<Dialogue speaker="MR LAMB">
Some do, some don't. I ask them. I like to learn.
</Dialogue>

<Dialogue speaker="DERRY">
I don't believe in them. I don't think anybody ever comes. You're here
all by yourself and miserable and no one would know if you were alive or dead
and nobody cares.
</Dialogue>

<Dialogue speaker="MR LAMB">
You think what you please.
</Dialogue>

<Dialogue speaker="DERRY">
All right then, tell me some of their names.
</Dialogue>

<Dialogue speaker="MR LAMB">
What are names? Tom, Dick or Harry. [Getting up] I'm off down to the
bees.
</Dialogue>

<Dialogue speaker="DERRY">
I think you're daft....crazy....
</Dialogue>

<Dialogue speaker="MR LAMB">
That's a good excuse.
</Dialogue>

<Dialogue speaker="DERRY">
What for? You don't talk sense.
</Dialogue>

<Dialogue speaker="MR LAMB">
Good excuse not to come back. And you've got a burned-up face, and
that's other people's excuse.
</Dialogue>

<Dialogue speaker="DERRY">
You're like the others, you like to say things like that. If you don't
feel sorry for my face, you're frightened of it, and if you're not frightened,
you think I'm ugly as a devil. I am a devil. Don't you? [Shouts]

[Mr Lamb does not reply. He has gone to his bees.]
</Dialogue>

<Dialogue speaker="DERRY">
[Quietly] No. You don't. I like it here.

[Pause. Derry gets up and shouts.]

I'm going. But I'll come back. You see. You wait. I can run. I haven't got a tin
leg. I'll be back.

[Derry runs off. Silence. The sounds of the garden again.]
</Dialogue>

<Dialogue speaker="MR LAMB">
[To himself] There my dears. That's you seen to. Ah....you know. We all
know. I'll come back. They never do, though. Not them. Never do come back.
</Dialogue>

[The garden noises fade.]

### SCENE TWO

Derry's house.

<Dialogue speaker="MOTHER">
You think I don't know about him, you think. I haven't heard things?
</Dialogue>

<Dialogue speaker="DERRY">
You shouldn't believe all you hear.
</Dialogue>

<Dialogue speaker="MOTHER">
Been told. Warned. We've not lived here three months, but I know what
there is to know and you're not to go back there.
</Dialogue>

<Dialogue speaker="DERRY">
What are you afraid of? What do you think he is? An old man with a tin
leg and he lives in a huge house without curtains and has a garden. And I want
to be there, and sit and....listen to things. Listen and look.
</Dialogue>

<Dialogue speaker="MOTHER">
Listen to what?
</Dialogue>

<Dialogue speaker="DERRY">
Bees singing. Him talking.
</Dialogue>

<Dialogue speaker="MOTHER">
And what's he got to say to you?
</Dialogue>

<Dialogue speaker="DERRY">
Things that matter. Things nobody else has ever said. Things I want to
think about.
</Dialogue>

<Dialogue speaker="MOTHER">
Then you stay here and do your thinking. You're best off here.
</Dialogue>

<Dialogue speaker="DERRY">
I hate it here.
</Dialogue>

<Dialogue speaker="MOTHER">
You can't help the things you say. I forgive you. It's bound to make you
feel bad things....and say them. I don't blame you.
</Dialogue>

<Dialogue speaker="DERRY">
It's got nothing to do with my face and what I look like. I don't care
about that and it isn't important. It's what I think and feel and what I want to
see and find out and hear. And I'm going back there. Only to help him with the
crab apples. Only to look at things and listen. But I'm going.
</Dialogue>

<Dialogue speaker="MOTHER">
You'll stop here.
</Dialogue>

<Dialogue speaker="DERRY">
Oh no, oh no. Because if I don't go back there, I'll never go anywhere in
this world again.

[The door slams. Derry runs, panting.]

And I want the world....I want it....I want it....

[The sound of his panting fades.]
</Dialogue>

### SCENE THREE

Mr Lamb's garden [Garden sounds: the noise of a branch shifting; apples thumping
down; the branch shifting again.]

<Dialogue speaker="MR LAMB">
Steady....that's....got it. That's it... [More apples fall]

And again. That's it....and....
</Dialogue>

[A creak. A crash. The ladder falls back, Mr Lamb with it. A thump. The branch
swishes back. Creaks. Then silence. Derry opens the garden gate, still panting.]

Mr Lamb, Mr....You've.....

[He runs through the grass. Stops. Kneels]

Mr Lamb, It's all right.

## Exercise

### Reading with Insight

#### Question 1

What is it that draws Derry towards Mr Lamb inspite of himself?

#### Question 2

In which section of the play does Mr Lamb display signs of loneliness and
disappointment? What are the ways in which Mr Lamb tries to overcome these
feelings?

#### Question 3

The actual pain or inconvenience caused by a physical impairment is often much
less than the sense of alienation felt by the person with disabilities. What is
the kind of behaviour that the person expects from others?

#### Question 4

Will Derry get back to his old seclusion or will Mr Lamb's brief association
effect a change in the kind of life he will lead in the future? On the Face of
It

### How about...

using your imagination to suggest another ending to the above story.
