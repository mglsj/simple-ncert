## My Mother at Sixty-six

Driving from my parent's\
home to Cochin last Friday\
morning, I saw my mother,\
beside me,\
doze, open mouthed, her face\
ashen like that\
of a corpse and realised with pain\
that she was as old as she\
looked but soon\
put that thought away, and\
looked out at Young\
Trees _sprinting_, the merry children spilling\
out of their homes, but after the airport's\
security check, standing a few yards\
away, I looked again at her, _wan_, pale\
as a late winter's moon and felt that old\
familiar ache, my childhood's fear,\
but all I said was, see you soon, Amma,\
all I did was smile and smile and\
smile......

## Think it out

### Question 1.

What is the kind of pain and ache that the poet feels?

### Question 2.

Why are the young trees described as 'sprinting'?

### Question 3.

Why has the poet brought in the image of the merry children 'spilling out of
their homes'?

### Question 4.

Why has the mother been compared to the 'late winter's moon'?

### Question 5.

What do the parting words of the poet and her smile signify?

Notice that the whole poem is in a single sentence, punctuated by commas.

It indicates a single thread of thought interspersed with observations of the
real world around and the way these are connected to the main idea.
