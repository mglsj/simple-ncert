## Aunt Jennifer's Tigers

Aunt Jennifer's tigers prance across a screen,\
Bright topaz denizens of a world of green.\
They do not fear the men beneath the tree;\
They pace in sleek chivalric certainty.

Aunt Jennifer's fingers fluttering through her wool\
Find even the ivory needle hard to pull.\
The massive weight of Uncle's wedding band\
Sits heavily upon Aunt Jennifer's hand.

When Aunt is dead, her terrified hands will lie\
Still ringed with ordeals she was mastered by.\
The tigers in the panel that she made\
Will go on prancing, proud and unafraid.

_**denizen:**_ a person, an animal or a plant that lives, grows or is often
found in a particular place.

_**sleek:**_ elegant

How do 'denizens' and 'chivalric' add to our understanding of the tiger's
attitudes?

#### Question 2

Why do you think Aunt Jennifer's hands are 'fluttering through her wool' in the
second stanza? Why is she finding the needle so hard to pull?

What is suggested by the image 'massive weight of Uncle's wedding band'?

#### Question 4

Of what or of whom is Aunt Jennifer terrified with in the third stanza?

that the poet uses the word 'ringed'? What are the meanings of the word 'ringed'
in the poem?

#### Question 6

own character? What might the poet be suggesting, through this difference?
