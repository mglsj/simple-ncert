## 12.1 Threats and Prevention ||section-12.1||

Being alone is the most ideal situation for an individual in terms of security.
It applies to computers as well. A computer with no link to an external device
or computer is free from the security threats arising otherwise. However, it is
not an ideal solution for a human being or a computer to stay aloof in order to
mitigate any security threats, as the world at present is on its way to become
fully connected. This connectedness of various devices and computers has brought
into our focus the various network threats and its prevention.

Network security is concerned with protection of our device as well as data from
illegitimate access or misuse. Threats include all the ways in which one can
exploit any vulnerability or weakness in a network or communication system in
order to cause harm or damage one's reputation.

## 12.2 Malware ||section-12.2||

Malware is a short term used for *MAL*icious soft*WARE*. It is any software
developed with an intention to damage hardware devices, steal data, or cause any
other trouble to the user. Various types of malware have been created from
time-to-time, and large-scale damages have been inflicted. Many of these malware
programs have been identified and counter measures have been initiated. However,
different types of malware keep on coming on a regular basis that compromise the
security of computer systems and cause intangible damages. Besides, each year,
malware incur financial damages worth billions of dollars worldwide. Viruses,
Worms, Ransomware, Trojans, and Spyware are some of the kinds of malware.

### 12.2.1 Virus ||section-12.2.1||

The term computer virus was coined by Fred Cohen in 1985 and has been borrowed
from biological science with almost similar meaning and behavior, the only
difference is that the victim is a computer system and the virus is a malicious
software. A virus is a piece of software code created to perform malicious
activities and hamper resources of a computer system like CPU time, memory,
personal files, or sensitive information.

Mimicking the behaviour of a biological virus, the computer virus spreads on
contact with another system, i.e. a computer virus infects other computer
systems that it comes into contact with by copying or inserting its code into
the computer programs or software (executable files). A virus remains dormant on
a system and is activated as soon as the infected file is opened (executed) by a
user.

Viruses behave differently, depending upon the reason or motivation behind their
creation. Some of the most common intentions or motives behind viruses include
stealing passwords or data, corrupting files, spamming the user's email
contacts, and even taking control of the user's machine. Some well-known viruses
include CryptoLocker, ILOVEYOU, MyDoom, Sasser and Netsky, Slammer, Stuxnet,
etc.

### 12.2.2 Worms ||section-12.2.2||

The Worm is also a malware that incurs unexpected or damaging behaviour on an
infected computer system. The major difference between a worm and a virus is
that unlike a virus, a worm does not need a host program or software to insert
its code into. Worms are standalone programs that are capable of working on its
own. Also, a virus needs human triggering for replication (i.e. when a user
opens/executes the infected file), while a worm replicates on its own and can
spread to other computers through the network. Some prominent examples of worms
include Storm Worm, Sobig, MSBlast, Code Red, Nimda, Morris Worm, etc.

### 12.2.3 Ransomware ||section-12.2.3||

It is a type of malware that targets user data. It either blocks the user from
accessing their own data or threatens to publish the personal data online and
demands ransom payment against the same. Some ransomware simply block the access
to the data while others encrypt data making it very difficult to access. In May
2017, a ransomware WannaCry infected almost 200,000 computers across 150
countries. It worked by encrypting data and demanding ransom payments in the
Bitcoin cryptocurrency. It literally made its victims "cry" and hence the name.

/>

### 12.2.4 Trojan

Since the ancient Greeks could not infiltrate the city of Troy using traditional
warfare methods, they gifted the king of Troy with a big wooden horse with
hidden soldiers inside and eventually defeated them. Borrowing the concept, a
Trojan is a malware, that looks like a legitimate software and once it tricks a
user into installing it, it acts pretty much like a virus or worm. However, a
Trojan does not self-replicate or infect other files, it spreads through user
interaction such as opening an email attachment or downloading and executing a
file from the Internet. Some Trojans create backdoors to give malicious users
access to the system.

<Figure
  id="12.2"
  title="Figure 12.2: A trojan horse"
  images={[{ src: import("./res/fig_12.2.png"), alt: "A trojan horse" }]}
/>

### 12.2.5 Spyware ||section-12.2.5||

It is a type of malware that spies on a person or an organisation by gathering
information about them, without the knowledge of the user. It records and sends
the collected information to an external entity without consent or knowledge of
the user.

Spyware usually tracks internet usage data and sells them to advertisers. They
can also be used to track and capture credit card or bank account information,
login and password information or user's personal identity.

### 12.2.6 Adware ||section-12.2.6||

An Adware is a malware that is created to generate revenue for its developer. An
adware displays online advertisements using pop-ups, web pages, or installation
screens. Once an adware has infected a substantial number of computer systems,
it generates revenue either by displaying advertisements or using "pay per
click" mechanism to charge its clients against the number of clicks on their
displayed ads. Adware is usually annoying, but harmless. However, it often paves
way for other malware by displaying unsafe links as advertisements.

### 12.2.7 Keyloggers ||section-12.2.7||

A keylogger can either be malware or hardware. The main purpose of this malware
is to record the keys pressed by a user on the keyboard. A keylogger makes logs
of daily keyboard usage and may send it to an external entity as well. In this
way, very sensitive and personal information like passwords, emails, private
conversations, etc. can be revealed to an external entity without the knowledge
of the user. One strategy to avoid the threat of password leaks by keyloggers is
to use a virtual keyboard while signing into your online accounts from an
unknown computer.

:::tip

To implement a keylogger in hardware, a thin transparent keyboard is placed atop
the actual keyboard or input pad of the intended machine, which then records the
keystrokes pressed by the user.

:::

#### (A) Online Virtual Keyboard Vs On-Screen Keyboard ||section-12.2.7.a||

The names "on-screen" and "virtual" keyboard refer to any software-based
keyboard and are sometimes used interchangeably. But, there exists a notable
difference between "on-screen" and "online virtual" keyboards. Both types of
keyboards may look the same, but the difference is in terms of the layout or
ordering of the keys. The on-screen keyboard of an operating system uses a fixed
QWERTY key layout ([Figure 12.3](#figure-12.2)), which can be exploited by sophisticated
keylogger software. However, an online virtual keyboard randomises the key
layout every time it is used ([Figure 12.4](#figure-12.4)), thereby making it very difficult for
a keylogger software to know or record the key(s) pressed by the user.

<Figure

    }
  ]}
/>

### 12.2.8 Modes of Malware distribution ||section-12.2.8||

A malware once designed, can take many routes to reach your computer. Some of
the common distribution channels for malware are:

- **Downloaded from the Internet:** Most of the time, malware is unintentionally
  downloaded into the hard drive of a computer by the user. Of course, the
  malware designers are smart enough to disguise their malware, but we should be
  very careful while downloading files from the Internet (especially those
  highlighted as free stuff).
- **Spam Email:** We often receive an unsolicited email with embedded hyperlinks
  or attachment files. These links or attached files can be malware.
- **Removable Storage Devices:** Often, the replicating malware targets the
  removable storage media like pen drives, SSD cards, music players, mobile
  phones, etc. and infect them with malware that gets transferred to other
  systems that they are plugged into.
- **Network Propagation:** Some malware like Worms have the ability to propagate
  from one computer to another through a network connection.

### 12.2.9 Combating Malware ||section-12.2.9||

Common signs of some malware infection include the following:

- frequent pop-up windows prompting you to visit some website and/or download
  some software;
- changes to the default homepage of your web browser;
- mass emails being sent from your email account;
- unusually slow computer with frequent crashes;
- unknown programs startup as you turn on your computer;
- programs opening and closing automatically;
- sudden lack of storage space, random messages, sounds, or music start to
  appear;
- programs or files appear or disappear without your knowledge.

Malware exists and continues to evolve, and so is the mechanism to combat them.
As the saying goes that prevention is better than cure, we list some preventive
measures against the malware discussed earlier.

- Using antivirus, anti-malware, and other related software and updating them on
  a regular basis.
- Configure your browser security settings
- Always check for a lock button in the address bar while making payments.
- Never use pirated on unlicensed software. Instead go for Free and Open Source
  Software (FOSS).
- Applying software updates and patches released by its manufacturers.
- Taking a regular backup of important data.
- Enforcing firewall protection in the network.
- Avoid entering sensitive (passwords, pins) or personal information on unknown
  or public computers.
- Avoid entering sensitive data on an unknown network (like Wi-Fi in a public
  place) using your own computer also.
- Avoid clicking on links or downloading attachments from unsolicited emails.
- Scan any removable storage device with an antivirus software before
  transferring data to and from it.
- Never share your online account or banking password/pins with anyone.
- Remove all the programs that you don't recognise from your system.
- Do not install an anti-spyware or antivirus program presented to you in a
  pop-up or ad.
- Use the pop-up window's 'X' icon located on the top-right of the popup to
  close the ad instead of clicking on the 'close' button in the pop-up. If you
  notice an installation has been started, cancel immediately to avoid further
  damage.

### 12.3 Antivirus ||section-12.3||

Antivirus is a software, also known as anti-malware. Initially, antivirus
software was developed to detect and remove viruses only and hence the name
anti- virus. However, with time it has evolved and now comes bundled with the
prevention, detection, and removal of a wide range of malware.

### 12.3.1 Methods of Malware Identification used by Antivirus ||section-12.3.1||

#### (A) Signature-based detection ||section-12.3.1.a||

In this method, an antivirus works with the help of a signature database known
as "Virus Definition File (VDF)". This file consists of virus signatures and is
updated continuously on a real-time basis. This makes the regular update of the
antivirus software a must. If there is an antivirus software with an outdated
VDF, it is as good as having no antivirus software installed, as the new malware
will infect the system without getting detected. This method also fails to
detect malware that has an ability to change its signature (polymorphic) and the
malware that has some portion of its code encrypted.

:::tip[Virus Signature]

A virus signature is a consecutive sequence of bytes that is commonly found in a
certain malware sample. That means it's contained within the malware or the
infected file and not in unaffected files.

:::

#### (B) Sandbox detection ||section-12.3.1.b||

In this method, a new application or file is executed in a virtual environment
(sandbox) and its behavioural fingerprint is observed for a possible malware.
Depending on its behaviour, the antivirus engine determines if it is a potential
threat or not and proceeds accordingly. Although this method is a little slow,
it is very safe as the new unknown application is not given access to actual
resources of the system.

#### (C) Data mining techniques ||section-12.3.1.c||

This method employs various data mining and machine learning techniques to
classify the behaviour of a file as either benign or malicious.

#### (D) Heuristics ||section-12.3.1.d||

Often, a malware infection follows a certain pattern. Here, the source code of a
suspected program is compared to viruses that are already known and are in the
heuristic database. If the majority of the source code matches with any code in
the heuristic database, the code is flagged as a possible threat.

#### (E) Real-time protection ||section-12.3.1.e||

Some malware remains dormant or gets activated after some time. Such malware
needs to be checked on a real-time basis. In this technique, the anti-malware
software keeps running in the background and observes the behavior of an
application or file for any suspicious activity while it is being executed i.e.
when it resides in the active (main) memory of the computer system.

## 12.4 Spam ||section-12.4||

Spam is a broad term and applies to various digital platforms like messaging,
forums, chatting, emailing, advertisement, etc. However, the widely recognised
form is email spam. Depending on their requirements, organisations or
individuals buy or create a mailing list (list of email addresses) and
repeatedly send advertisement links and invitation emails to a large number of
users. This creates unnecessary junk in the inbox of the receiver's email and
often tricks a user into buying something or downloading a paid software or
malware.

Nowadays, email services like Gmail, Hotmail, etc. have an automatic spam
detection algorithm that filters emails and makes things easier for the end
users. A user can also mark an undetected unsolicited email as "spam", thereby
ensuring that such type of email is not delivered into the inbox as normal email
in future.

## 12.5 HTTP vs HTTPS ||section-12.5||

Both the HTTP (Hyper Text Transfer Protocol) and its variant HTTPS (Hyper Text
Transfer Protocol Secure) are a set of rules (protocol) that govern how data can
be transmitted over the WWW (World Wide Web). In other words, they provide rules
for the client web browser and servers to communicate.

:::tip

Always look for the `https://` at the beginning of the address (URL) of the
websites while entering your banking, personal, or other sensitive information.

:::

HTTP sends information over the network as it is. It does not scramble the data
to be transmitted, leaving it vulnerable to attacks from hackers. Hence, HTTP is
sufficient for websites with public information sharing like news portals,
blogs, etc. However, when it comes to dealing with personal information, banking
credentials and passwords, we need to communicate data more securely over the
network using HTTPS. HTTPS encrypts the data before transmission. At the
receiver end, it decrypts to recover the original data. The HTTPS based websites
require SSL Digital Certificate.

### 12.6 Firewall ||section-12.6||

Computer firewall is a network security system designed to protect a trusted
private network from unauthorised access or traffic originating from an
untrusted outside network (e.g., the Internet or different sections of the same
network) to which it is connected ([Figure 12.5](#figure-12.5)). Firewall can be implemented in
software, hardware or both. As discussed earlier, a malware like worm has the
capability to move across the networks and infect other computers. The firewall
acts as the first barrier against malware.

<Figure
  id="12.5"
  title="Figure 12.5: A firewall between two networks"
  images={[
    { 
      src: import("./res/fig_12.5.svg"), 
      srcDark: import("./res/fig_12.5.dark.svg"),
      alt: "A firewall between two networks" 
    }
  ]}
/>

A firewall acts as a network filter and based on the predefined security rules,
it continuously monitors and controls the incoming and outgoing traffic. As an
example, a rule can be set in the firewall of a school LAN, that a student
cannot access data from the finance server, while the school accountant can
access the finance server.

<Activity id="12.1" title="Activity 12.1">
Ask your teacher to show you how to enable and disable firewall on your
computer.
</Activity>

### 12.6.1 Types of Firewall ||section-12.6.1||

- **Network Firewall:** If the firewall is placed between two or more networks
  and monitors the network traffic between different networks, it is termed as
  Network Firewall.
- **Host-based Firewall:** If the firewall is placed on a computer and monitors
  the network traffic to and from that computer, it is called a host-based
  firewall.

<Think title="Think and Reflect">


Assume students in a class are to finish their project. For this, the access to
the Internet has also been given. To ensure maximum output i.e timely
completion, can you utilise Firewall to prevent distraction while surfing the
net?

</Think>

## 12.7 Cookies ||section-12.7||

The term "cookie" was derived from the term "magic cookie" used by Unix
programmers to indicate a packet of data that a program receives and sends it
back unchanged. A computer cookie is a small file or data packet, which is
stored by a website on the client's computer. A cookie is edited only by the
website that created it, the client's computer acts as a host to store the
cookie. Cookies are used by the websites to store browsing information of the
user. For example, while going through an e-commerce website, when a user adds
items to cart, the website usually uses cookies to record the items in the cart.
A cookie can also be used to store other user-centric information like login
credentials, language preference, search queries, recently viewed web pages,
music choice, favorite cuisine, etc., that helps in enhancing the user
experience and making browsing time more productive.

Depending upon their task, there are different types of cookies. Session cookies
keep track of the current session and even terminate the session when there is a
time-out (banking website). So, if you accidentally left your e-banking page
open, it will automatically close after the time-out. Similarly, authentication
cookies are used by a website to check if the user is previously logged in
(authenticated) or not. This way, you don't need to login again and again while
visiting different web pages or links of the same website. You might have also
noticed that certain information like your Name, Address, Contact, D.O.B, etc.
automatically fills up while filling an online form. This auto-fill feature is
also implemented by websites using cookies.

<Activity id="12.2" title="Activity 12.2">
Open your internet browser and check the settings for cookies. Also, try to
locate some cookie files on your computer system.
</Activity>

### 12.7.1 Threats due to Cookies ||section-12.7.1||

Usually, cookies are used for enhancing the user's browsing experience and do
not infect your computer with malware. However, some malware might disguise as
cookies e.g. "supercookies". There is another type of cookie known as "Zombie
cookie" that gets recreated after being deleted. Some third-party cookies might
share user data without the consent of the user for advertising or tracking
purposes. As a common example, if you search for a particular item using your
search engine, a third-party cookie will display advertisements showing similar
items on other websites that you visit later. So, one should be careful while
granting permission to any websites to create and store cookies on the user
computer.

## 12.8 Hackers and Crackers ||section-12.8||

Hackers and crackers are people having a thorough knowledge of the computer
systems, system software (operating system), computer networks, and programming.
They use this knowledge to find loopholes and vulnerabilities in computer
systems or computer networks and gain access to unauthorised information. In
simple terms, a hacker is a person that is skilled enough to hack or take
control of a computer system. Depending on the intent, there are different types
of hackers.

:::tip

A hacktivist is a hacker with an aim to bring about political and social change.

:::

### 12.8.1 White Hats: Ethical Hacker ||section-12.8.1||

If a hacker uses its knowledge to find and help in fixing the security flaws in
the system, its termed as White Hat hacker. These are the hackers with good
intentions. They are actually security experts. Organisations hire ethical or
white hat hackers to check and fix their systems for potential security threats
and loopholes. Technically, white hats work against black hats.

### 12.8.2 Black Hats: Crackers ||section-12.8.2||

If hackers use their knowledge unethically to break the law and disrupt security
by exploiting the flaws and loopholes in a system, then they are called black
hat hackers.

### 12.8.3 Grey Hats ||section-12.8.3||

The distinction between different hackers is not always clear. There exists a
grey area in between, which represents the class of hackers that are neutral,
they hack systems by exploiting its vulnerabilities, but they don't do so for
monetary or political gains. The grey hats take system security as a challenge
and just hack systems for the fun of it.

## 12.9 Network Security Threats ||section-12.9||

### 12.9.1 Denial of Service ||section-12.9.1||

Denial of Service (DoS) is a scenario, wherein an attacker (Hacker) limits or
stops an authorised user to access a service, device, or any such resource by
overloading that resource with illegitimate requests. The DoS attack floods the
victim resource with traffic, making the resource appear busy. If attackers
carry out a DoS attack on a website, they will flood it with a very large number
of network packets by using different IP addresses. This way, the web server
would be overloaded and will not be able to provide service to a legitimate
user. The users will think that the website is not working, causing damage to
the victim's organisation. Same way, DoS attacks can be done on resources like
email servers, network storage, disrupting connection between two machines or
disrupting the state of information (resetting of sessions).

If a DoS attack makes a server crash, the server or resource can be restarted to
recover from the attack. However, a flooding attack is difficult to recover
from, as there can be some genuine legitimate requests in it as well.

A variant of DoS, known as Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) is an attack,
where the flooded requests come from compromised computer (Zombies) systems
distributed across the globe or over a very large area. The attacker installs a
malicious software known as Bot on the Zombie machines, which gives it control
over these machines. Depending upon the requirement and availability, the
attacker activates a network of these Zombie computers known as Bot-Net to carry
out the DDoS attack. While as a simple DoS attack may be countered by blocking
requests or network packets from a single source, DDoS is very difficult to
resolve, as the attack is carried from multiple distributed locations.

### 12.9.2 Intrusion Problems ||section-12.9.2||

Network Intrusion refers to any unauthorised activity on a computer network.
These activities may involve unauthorised use of network resources (DoS) or
threatening the security of the network and the data. Network intrusion is a
very serious problem and the network administrator needs to devise strategy and
implement various security measures to protect the network. We have already
discussed some of the intrusion attacks such as DoS, Trojans, and Worms. The
remaining attacks are briefly discussed below.

#### (A) Asymmetric Routing ||section-12.9.2.a||

The attacker tends to avoid detection by sending the intrusion packets through
multiple paths, thereby bypassing the network intrusion sensors.

#### (B) Buffer Overflow Attacks ||section-12.9.2.b||

In this attack, the attacker overwrites certain memory areas of the computers
within the network with code (set of commands) that will be executed later when
the buffer overflow (programming error) occurs. Once the malicious code is
executed, an attacker can initiate a DoS attack or gain access to the network.

#### (C) Traffic Flooding ||section-12.9.2.c||

It is one of the most trivial methods of network intrusion. It involves flooding
the network intrusion detection system with message packets. This huge load
leaves the network detection system incapable of monitoring the packets
adequately. The hacker takes advantage of this congested and chaotic network
environment to sneak into the system undetected.

### 12.9.3 Snooping ||section-12.9.3||

Snooping means secretly listening to a conversation. In the context of
networking, it refers to the process of secret capture and analysis of network
traffic. It is a computer program or utility that has a network traffic
monitoring capability. In this attack, the hacker taps or listens to a channel
of communication by picking all of the traffic passing through it. Once the
network packets are analysed by the snooping device or software, it reproduces
the exact traffic packets and places them back in the channel, as if nothing has
happened. So, if the data that is being sent over the network is not encrypted,
it is vulnerable to snooping and eventually may cause serious damage, depending
upon the type of information leak. However, snooping is not always an attack, at
times it is also used by network administrators for troubleshooting various
network issues. Snooping is also known as Sniffing.

Various snooping software exist that act as network traffic analyser. Besides,
various network hubs and switches have a SPAN (Sniffer Port Analyser) port
function for snooping.

:::tip[URL Snooping]

It is a software package that downloads and stores a web stream as a file, that
can be viewed or used later. The common online video downloaders use the same
techniques to download videos from the Web.

:::

### 12.9.4 Eavesdropping ||section-12.9.4||

The term eavesdropping has been derived from the literal practice of secretly
listening to the conversations of people by standing under the eaves of a house.
Unlike snooping, where the network traffic can be stored for later analysis,
eavesdropping is an unauthorised real-time interception or monitoring of private
communication between two entities over a network. Also, the targets are usually
the private communication channels like phone calls (VoIP), instant messages,
video conference, fax transmission, etc. In older days, eavesdropping was
performed on the conventional telephone line and was known as wiretapping.
Digital devices like laptops and cell phones that have a built-in microphone or
camera can be easily hacked and eavesdropped using rootkit malware.

<Figure
  id="12.6"
  title="Figure 12.6: Eavesdropping"
  images={[
    {
      src: import("./res/fig_12.6.svg"),
      alt: "Eavesdropping"
    }
  ]}
/>

Eavesdropping is different from Snooping. While the former happens in real time,
the latter does not. As an example, in eavesdropping, imagine someone listening
to your private conversation with the help of a hidden microphone in your room
or by physically standing near the window of your room. However, in snooping,
that person may make a copy of a letter that is addressed to your friend and
keep the copy with himself and send the original letter to the intended address.

## Exercise
