## 11.1 Concept of Communication ||section-11.1||

The term "Data Communication" comprises two words: Data and Communication. Data
can be any text, image, audio, video, and multimedia files. Communication is an
act of sending or receiving data. Thus, data communication refers to the
exchange of data between two or more networked or connected devices. These
devices must be capable of sending and receiving data over a communication
medium. Examples of such devices include personal computers, mobile phones,
laptops, etc. As we can see in [Figure 11.1](#figure-11.1), four different types
of devices — computer, printer, server and switch are connected to form the
network. These devices are connected through a media to the network, which carry
information from one end to other end.

## 11.2 Components of Data Communication ||section-11.2||

Whenever we talk about communication between two computing devices using a
network, five most important aspects come to our mind. These are sender,
receiver, communication medium, the message to be communicated, and certain
rules called protocols to be followed during communication. The communication
media is also called transmission media. [Figure 11.2](#figure-11.2) shows the
role of these five components in data communication.

**Sender:** A sender is a computer or any such device which is capable of
sending data over a network. It can be a computer, mobile phone, smartwatch,
walkie- talkie, video recording device, etc.

**Receiver:** A receiver is a computer or any such device which is capable of
receiving data from the network. It can be any computer, printer, laptop, mobile
phone, television, etc. In computer communication, the sender and receiver are
known as nodes in a network.

<Activity id="11.1" title="Activity 11.1">
List various types of senders on a network.
</Activity>

**Message:** It is the data or information that needs to be exchanged between
the sender and the receiver. Messages can be in the form of text, number, image,
audio, video, multimedia, etc.

**Communication media:** It is the path through which the message travels
between source and destination. It is also called medium or link which is either
wired or wireless. For example, a television cable, telephone cable, ethernet
cable, satellite link, microwaves, etc. We will study about various
communication media in [section 11.5](#section-11.5).

**Protocols:** It is a set of rules that need to be followed by the
communicating parties in order to have successful and reliable data
communication. You have already come across protocols such as Ethernet and HTTP.

## 11.3 Measuring Capacity of Communication Media ||section-11.3||

In data communication, the transmission medium is also known as channel. The
capacity of a channel is the maximum amount of signals or traffic that a channel
can carry. It is measured in terms of bandwidth and data transfer rate as
described below:

<Activity id="11.2" title="Activity 11.2">
Find out how many hertz is 10 Megahertz.
</Activity>

### 11.3.1 Bandwidth ||section-11.3.1||

Bandwidth of a channel is the range of frequencies available for transmission of
data through that channel. Higher the bandwidth, higher the data transfer rate.
Normally, bandwidth is the difference of maximum and minimum frequency contained
in the composite signals. Bandwidth is measured in Hertz ($Hz$).

$$
1 KHz = 1000 Hz
$$

$$
1 MHz = 1000 KHz = 1000000 Hz
$$

### 11.3.2 Data Transfer Rate ||section-11.3.2||

Data travels in the form of signals over a channel. One signal carries one or
more bits over the channel. Data transfer rate is the number of bits transmitted
between source and destination in one second. It is also known as bit rate. It
is measured in terms of bits per second (bps). The higher units for data
transfer rates are:

$$
1 Kbps=210 bps=1024 bps
$$

$$
1 Mbps=220 bps=1024 Kbps
$$

$$
1 Gbps=230 bps=1024 Mbps
$$

$$
1 Tbps=240 bps=1024 Gbps
$$

:::tip

MBps stands for Megabyte per second whereas Mbps stands for Megabit per second.

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>

$$
\text{Required data rate} = \frac{10 \times 1600 \times 8}{20} bps
$$

$$

$$

</Example>

## 11.4 Types of Data Communication ||section-11.4||

Data communication happens in the form of signals between two or more computing
devices or nodes. The transfer of data happens over a point-to-point or
multipoint communication channel. Data communication between different devices
are broadly categorised into 3 types: Simplex communication, Half- duplex
communication, and Full-duplex communication.

### 11.4.1 Simplex Communication ||section-11.4.1||

It is a one way or unidirectional communication between two devices in which one
device is sender and other one is receiver. Devices use the entire capacity of
the link to transmit the data. It is like a one way street where vehicles can
move in only one direction. For example, data entered through a keyboard or
audio sent to a speaker are one way communications.

With the advent of IoT, controlling home appliances is another example of
simplex communication as shown in the [Figure 11.3](#figure-11.3). One can
control fans, lights, fridge, oven etc. while sitting in the office or driving a
car.

<Figure 
  id="11.3"

      srcDark: import('./res/fig_11.3.dark.svg'),
      alt: "Simplex communication"
    }
  ]}
/>

### 11.4.2 Half-duplex Communication ||section-11.4.2||

It is two way or bidirectional communication between two devices in which both
the devices can send and receive data or control signals in both directions, but
not at the same time, as shown in [Figure 11.4](#figure-11.4). While one device
is sending data, the other one will receive and vice-versa. It is like sharing a
one-way narrow bridge among vehicles moving in both directions. Vehicles cannot
pass the bridge simultaneously. Basically, it is a simplex channel where the
direction of transmission can be switched. Application of such type of
communication can be found in walkie-talkie where one can press the push-to-talk
button and talk. This enables the transmitter and turns off the receiver in that
device and others can only listen.

<Figure 
  id="11.4" 
  title="Figure 11.4: Half-duplex communication"
  images={[
    {
      src: import('./res/fig_11.4.svg'),
      srcDark: import('./res/fig_11.4.dark.svg'),
      alt: "Half-duplex communication"
    }
  ]}
/>

### 11.4.3 Full-duplex Communication ||section-11.4.3||

It is two way or bidirectional communication in which both devices can send and
receive data simultaneously, as shown in [Figure 11.5](#figure-11.5). It is like
a two way road where vehicles can go in both directions at the same time. This
type of communication channel is employed to allow simultaneous communication,
for example, in our mobile phones and landline telephones. The capacity of the
transmission link is shared between the signals going in both directions. This
can be done either by using two physically separate simplex lines — one for
sending and other for receiving, or the capacity of the single channel is shared
between the signals travelling in different directions.

multimedia communications over Internet protocol.

## 11.5 Switching Techniques ||section-11.5||

In a network having multiple devices, we are interested to know how to connect
the sender and receiver so that one-to-one communication is possible. One
solution is to make a dedicated connection between each pair of devices (mesh
topology) or between a central device and every other device (a star topology).
However, we know that such methods are costly in case of large networks.

An alternative to this is switching whereby data is routed through various nodes
in a network. This switching process forms a temporary route for the data to be
transmitted. Two commonly used switching techniques are — Circuit Switching and
Packet Switching.

:::tip

Voice over Long- Term Evolution (VoLTE) is a standard for high- speed wireless
communication for mobile phones, including IoT and wearables.

:::

### 11.5.1 Circuit Switching ||section-11.5.1||

In circuit switching, before a communication starts, a dedicated path is
identified between the sender and the receiver. This path is a connected
sequence of links between network nodes. All packets follow the same path
established during the connection.

In earlier days, when we placed a telephone call, the switching equipment within
the telephone system finds out a physical path or channel all the way from our
telephone at home to the receiver's telephone. This is an example of circuit
switching.

### 11.5.2 Packet Switching ||section-11.5.2||

In packet switching, each information or message to be transmitted between
sender and receiver is broken down into smaller pieces, called packets. These
packets are then transmitted independently through the network. Different
packets of the same message may take different routes depending on availability.

Each packet has two parts — a header containing the address of the destination
and other information, and the main message part. When all the packets reach the
destination, they are reassembled and the complete message is received by the
receiver.

Unlike circuit switching, a channel is occupied in packet switching only during
the transmission of the packet. On completion of the transmission, the channel
is available for transfer of packets from other communicating parties.

## 11.6 Transmission Media ||section-11.6||

A transmission medium can be anything that can carry signals or data between the
source (transmitter) and destination (receiver). For example, as we switch on a
ceiling fan or a light bulb, the electric wire is the medium that carries
electric current from switch to the fan or bulb. Two men are talking as shown in
[Figure 11.6](#figure-11.6). Here the medium is air.

<Figure id="11.6" 
  title="Figure 11.6: Two person communicating" 
  invertable={true}
  images={[
    {
      src: import('./res/fig_11.6.svg'),
      alt: "Two person communicating"
    }
  ]}
/>

In data communication, transmission media are the links that carry messages
between two or more communicating devices. Transmission can be classified as
guided or unguided. [Figure 11.7](#figure-11.7) shows the classification of
communication media.

In guided transmission, there is a physical link made of wire/cable through
which data in terms of signals are propagated between the nodes. These are
usually metallic cable, fiber-optic cable, etc. They are also known as wired
media.

In unguided transmission, data travels in air in terms of electromagnetic waves
using an antenna. They are also known as wireless media.

Dish-shaped antennas are used for sending and receiving data at longer
distances. These antennas are mounted on taller buildings so that it would be in
line-of- sight. Waves gradually become weaker and weaker after travelling a
certain distance through the air. Therefore repeaters are installed to
regenerate the signals of the same energy.

### 11.6.1 Wired Transmission Media ||section-11.6.1||

Any physical link that can carry data in the form of signals belongs to the
category of wired transmission media. Three commonly used guided/wired media for
data transmission are, twisted pair, coaxial cable, and fiber optic cable.
Twisted-pair and coaxial cable carry the electric signals whereas the optical
fiber cable carries the light signals.

#### (A) Twisted Pair Cable ||section-11.6.1.a||

A twisted-pair consists of two copper wires twisted like a DNA helical
structure. Both the copper wires are insulated with plastic covers. Usually, a
number of such pairs are combined together and covered with a protective outer
wrapping, as shown in [Figure 11.8](#figure-11.8).

<Figure 
  id="11.8" 
  title="Figure 11.8: Twisted pair of cables"
  images={[
    {
      src: import('./res/fig_11.8.svg'),
      srcDark: import('./res/fig_11.8.dark.svg'),
      alt: "Twisted pair of cables"
    }
  ]}
/>

Each of the twisted pairs act as a single communication link. The use of twisted
configuration minimises the effect of electrical interference from similar pairs
close by. Twisted pairs are less expensive and most commonly used in telephone
lines and LANs. These cables are of two types: Unshielded twisted-pair (UTP) and
Shielded twisted-pair (STP), as shown in [Figure 11.9](#figure-11.9).

<Figure 
  id="11.9" 
  title="Figure 11.9: UTP Cable and STP Cable"

      alt: "UTP Cable and STP Cable"
    }

:::tip

Backbone networks interconnect different segments of the network and provide a
path to exchange information between different LANs or subnetworks..

:::

#### (B) Coaxial cable ||section-11.6.1.b||

Coaxial cable is another type of data transmission medium. It is better shielded
and has more bandwidth than a twisted pair. As shown in
[Figure 11.10](#figure-11.10), it has a copper wire at the core of the cable
which is surrounded with insulating material. The insulator is further
surrounded with an outer conductor (usually a copper mesh). This outer conductor
is wrapped in a plastic cover. The key to success of coaxial cable is its
shielded design that allows the cable's copper core to transmit data quickly,
without interference of environmental factors. These types of cables are used to
carry signals of higher frequencies to a longer distance.

:::tip

The number of oscillations a wave makes per second is called its frequency, and
it is measured in Hz (Hertz).

:::

#### (C) Optical Fibre ||section-11.6.1.c||

The optical fiber cable carries data as light, which travels inside a thin fiber
of glass ([Figure 11.11](#figure-11.11)). Optic fiber uses refraction to direct
the light through the media. A thin transparent strand of glass at the centre is
covered with a layer of less dense glass called cladding. This whole arrangement
is covered with an outer jacket made of PVC or Teflon. Such types of cables are
usually used in backbone networks. These cables are of light weight and have
higher bandwidth which means higher data transfer rate. Signals can travel
longer distances and electromagnetic noise cannot affect the cable. However,
optic fibers are expensive and unidirectional. Two cables are required for full
duplex communication.

Internet service, similar to the way satellite is used for television and

### 11.6.2 Wireless Transmission Media

In wireless communication technology, information In wireless communication
technology, information travels in the form of electromagnetic signals through
air. Electromagnetic spectrum of frequency ranging from $3 KHz$ to $900 THz$ is
available for wireless communication ([Figure 11.12](#figure-11.2)). Wireless
technologies allow communication between two or more devices in short to long
distance without requiring any physical media. There are many types of wireless
communication technologies such as Bluetooth, WiFi, WiMax etc.

The electromagnetic spectrum range ($3KHz$ to $900THz$) can be divided into 4
categories ([Figure 11.12](#figure-11.2)) - Radio waves, Microwaves, Infrared
waves and Visible or Light waves, according to their frequency ranges. Some of
the properties of each wave are listed in [Table 11.1](#table-11.1). of these,
three are useful for wireless communication.

### 11.6.3 Wireless Technologies ||section-11.6.3||

#### (A) Bluetooth ||section-11.6.3.a||

Bluetooth is a short-range wireless technology that can be used to connect
mobile-phones, mouse, headphones, keyboards, computers, etc. wirelessly over a
short distance. One can print documents with bluetooth- enabled printers without
a physical connection. All these bluetooth-enabled devices have a low cost
transceiver chip. This chip uses the unlicensed frequency band of $2.4 GHz$ to
transmit and receive data. These devices can send data within a range of 10
meters with a speed of $1 - 2 Mbps$.

In Bluetooth technology, the communicating devices within a range of 10 meters
build a personal area network called piconet. The devices in a piconet work in a
master-slave configuration. A master device can communicate with up to 7 active
slave devices at the same time.

Bluetooth technology allows up to 255 devices to build a network. Out of them, 8
devices can communicate at the same time and remaining devices can be inactive,
waiting for a response command from the master device.

#### (B) Wireless LAN ||section-11.6.3.b||

This is another way of wireless communication. Wireless LAN is a local area
network (LAN), and it is a popular way to connect to the Internet. The
international organisation IEEE assigns numbers to each different standards of
LAN. The wireless LAN is number as [$802.11$](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_802.11), and it is popularly known as Wi-Fi.

These networks consist of communicating devices such as laptops and mobile
phones, as well as the network device called APs (access points) which is
installed in buildings or floors ([Figure 11.13](#figure-11.13)). An access
point is a device that is used to create a wireless local area network, by
connecting to a wired router, switch, or hub. The APs are connected to a wired
network, and all the devices communicate or access the Internet through an
access point.

Wi-Fi gives users the flexibility to move around within the network area while
being connected to the network. Following are some of the benefits of WLAN:

- Wireless connections can be used to extend or replace an existing wired
  infrastructure
- Resulted in increased access for mobile devices
- Provides easy access to the Internet in public places

:::tip

WiMax stands for Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access. Like Wi-Fi, it
is also used for communication in wireless networks but there is a difference.
Whereas Wi-Fi is used to form small wireless networks (WLANs), WiMax uses a
larger spectrum to deliver connections to various devices on the network. It has
a higher data transfer rate and can span over a larger area. That is why it is
used in MAN applications.

## 11.7 Mobile Telecommunication Technologies ||section-11.7||

Today the mobile phone network is the most used network in the world. The
ability to be connected to the network on-the-go makes it very convenient to
communicate with people via call or instant messages. It is also handy to access
the Internet using the mobile phone network through wireless connection.
Besides, the Internet of Things (IoT) is letting us control and communicate with
other smart devices as well.

The architecture of the mobile network has rapidly evolved over the last few
decades. The different landmark achievements in mobile communication
technologies are classified as different generations. They are identified as 1G,
2G, 3G, 4G, and 5G. Let us briefly discuss the mobile telecommunication
generations.

The first generation (1G) mobile network system came around 1982. It was used to
transmit only voice calls. The analog signals were used to carry voices between
the caller and receiver.

The second generation (2G) mobile network system came around 1991. Instead of
analog signals, voice calls were transmitted in digital form thus providing
improved call quality. This increased capacity allowed more people to talk
simultaneously, and led to improved security as the signals could be encrypted.
It also enabled an additional service to send SMS and MMS (Multimedia messages).

The third generation (3G) mobile network technology was developed during late
90s, but it was introduced commercially around 2001. It offered both digital
voice and data services. 3G provided Internet access via the same radio towers
that provide voice service to the mobile phone. It facilitated greater voice and
data capacity. Therefore, more simultaneous calls could happen in the same
frequency range and also a significantly faster data transfer speed.

Demand for faster data is always increasing and thus 4G mobile networks were
developed and now 5G networks have also come into being. 4G is much faster than
3G and this has revolutionised the field of telecommunication by bringing the
wireless experience to a new level altogether. 4G systems support interactive
multimedia, voice, video, wireless internet and other broadband services.
Technologically, 4G is very different compared to 3G.

The fifth generation or 5G is currently under development. It is expected to be
a milestone development for the success of IoT and Machine to Machine (M2M)
communications. Machine to machine (M2M) is direct communication between devices
— wired and wireless. 5G is expected to allow data transfer in Gbps, which is
much faster than 4G. It is expected to be able to support all the devices of the
future such as connected vehicles and the Internet of Things.

## 11.8 Protocol ||section-11.8||

In communication, Protocol is a set of standard rules that the communicating
parties — the sender, the receiver, and all other intermediate devices need to
follow. We know that the sender and receiver can be parts of different networks,
placed at different geographic locations. Besides, the data transfer rates in
different networks can vary, requiring data to be sent in different formats.

### 11.8.1 Need for Protocols ||section-11.8.1||

We need protocols for different reasons such as flow control, access control,
addressing, etc. Flow control is required when the sender and receiver have
different speeds of sending and receiving the data. [Figure 11.14](#) shows that
Computer A is sending data at the speed of $1024 Mbps$ and computer B is
receiving data at the speed of $512 Mbps$. In this case, Computer B must be able
to inform computer A about the speed mismatch so that computer A can adjust its
data transmission rate. Otherwise some data will be lost, as shown in
[Figure 11.14](#figure-11.14).

Access control is required to decide which nodes in a communication channel will
access the link shared among them at a particular instant of time. Otherwise,
the transmitted data packets will collide if computers are sending data
simultaneously through the same link resulting in the loss or corruption of
data.

    }

**Protocols also define:**

- how computers identify one another on a network.
- the form to which the data should be converted for transit.
- how to decide whether the data received is for that node or to be forwarded to
  another node.
- ensuring that all the data have reached the destination without any loss.
- how to rearrange the packets and process them at the destination.

If all the rules or protocols of a communication network are defined at one
place, it becomes complex to ensure that communicating parties follow the
guidelines. In this section, we will briefly talk about some of the protocols
required in communication.

### 11.8.2 HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP) ||section-11.8.2||

HTTP stands for HyperText Transfer Protocol. It is the primary protocol used to
access the World Wide Web. Tim Berners-Lee led the development of HTTP at CERN
in 1989 in collaboration with Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) and the
World Wide Web Consortium (W3C).

HTTP is a request-response (also called client- server) protocol that runs over
TCP. The common use of HTTP is between a web browser (client) and a web server
(server). HTTP facilitates access of hypertext from the World Wide Web by
defining how information are formatted and transmitted, and how the Web servers
and browsers should respond to various commands.

A web page is written using a markup language like HTML and is stored on a web
server for access via its URL. Once a user opens a web browser and types in the
URL of the intended web page, a logical communication link between the user
machine (client) and the web server is created using HTTP.

For example, whenever we enter the URL http//www.ncert.nic.in in a browser, it
sends HTTP request to the web-server where ncert.nic.in is hosted. The HTTP
response from the web-server fetches and sends the requested Web-page, which is
displayed on your browser.

### 11.8.3 File Transfer Protocol (FTP) ||section-11.8.3||

File Transfer Protocol (FTP) is the protocol used for transferring files from
one machine to another. Like HTTP, FTP also works on a client-server model.

When a user requests for a file transfer with another system, FTP sets up a
connection between the two nodes for accessing the file. Optionally, the user
can authenticate using user ID and password. The user then specifies the file
name and location of the desired file. After that, another connection sets up
and the file transfer happens directly between the two machines. However, some
servers provide FTP logins without authentication for accessing files.

File transfer between two systems seems simple and straightforward because FTP
takes care of issues between two communicating devices, such as:

- use of different conventions while naming files.
- representation of text and data in different formats.
- having different directory structure

### 11.8.4 Point to Point Protocol (PPP) ||section-11.8.4||

PPP is a communication protocol which establishes a dedicated and direct
connection between two communicating devices. This protocol defines how two
devices will authenticate each other and establish a direct link between them to
exchange data. For example, two routers with direct connection communicate using
PPP. The Internet users who connect their home computers to the server of an
Internet Service Provider (ISP) through a modem also use PPP.

The communicating devices should have duplex modes for using this protocol. This
protocol maintains data integrity ensuring that the packets arrive in order. It
intimates the sender about damage or lost packets and asks to resend it.

### 11.8.5 Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) ||section-11.8.5||

SMTP is a protocol used for email services. It uses information written on the
message header (like an envelope on a letter sent by post), and is not concerned
with the content of the email message. Each email header contains email
addresses of recipients. The email containing header and body are entered into a
queue of outgoing mails.

The SMTP sender program takes mails from the outgoing queue and transmits them
to the destination(s). When the SMTP sender successfully delivers a particular
mail to one or more destinations, it removes the corresponding receiver's email
address from the mail's destination list. When that mail is delivered to all the
recipients, it is removed from the outgoing queue. The SMTP receiver program
accepts each mail that has arrived and places it in the appropriate user
mailbox.

### 11.8.6 Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) / Internet Protocol (IP) ||section-11.8.6||

TCP/IP stands for Transmission Control Protocol/ Internet Protocol. It is a set
of standardised rules that uses a client-server model of communication in which
a user or machine (a client) requests a service by a server in the network.

The IP protocol ensures that each computer or node connected to the Internet is
assigned an IP address, which is used to identify each node independently. It
can be considered to be the adhesive that holds the whole Internet together. TCP
ensures that the message or data is broken into smaller chunks, called IP
packets. Each of these packets are routed (transmitted) through the Internet,
along a path from one router to the next, until it reaches the specified
destination. TCP guarantees the delivery of packets on the designated IP
address. It is also responsible for ordering the packets so that they are
delivered in sequence.

There are many redundant connection paths in the Internet, with backbones and
ISPs connecting to each other in multiple locations. So, there are many possible
paths between two hosts. Hence, two packets of the same message can take two
different routes depending on congestion and other factors in different possible
routes. When all the packets finally reach the destination machine, they are
reassembled into the original message at the receiver's end.

## Summary

<Summary>
- Data communication refers to the exchange of data between two or more
  networked or connected devices like laptops, PC, printers, routers etc.
- Sender, receiver, messages, channel and protocols are major components of data
  communication.
- In data communication, transmission media are the links that carry messages
  between two or more communicating devices. These are broadly classified into
  guided and unguided media.
- In guided transmission, there is a physical link made of wire/cable through
  which data in terms of signals are propagated between the nodes. These are
  usually metallic cable, fiber-optic cable, etc. They are also known as wired
  media.
- In unguided transmission, data travels in air in terms of electromagnetic
  waves using an antenna. They are also known as wireless media.
- The capacity of channels is measured in bandwidth. The unit of bandwidth is
  Hertz.
- Communication can be done in three different modes — simplex, half-duplex, and
  full-duplex communication.
- Switching techniques are alternative to dedicated lines whereby data is routed
  through various nodes in a network. It forms a temporary route for the data to
  be transmitted. Two commonly used switching techniques are – circuit switching
  and packet switching.
- Electromagnetic spectrum of frequency ranging from 3 KHz to 900 THz is
  available for wireless communication. This spectrum range (3KHz to 900THz) can
  be divided into four categories- Radio waves, Microwaves, Infrared waves and
  Visible or Light waves, according to their frequency ranges.
- Bluetooth is a short-range wireless technology that can be used to connect
  mobile-phones, mouse, headphones, keyboards, computers, etc. wirelessly over a
  short distance.
- Based on the architecture of the mobile network, mobile communication
  technologies are classified into different generations identified as 1G, 2G,
  3G, 4G, and 5G.
- In communication, protocol is a set of standard rules that the communicating
  parties — the sender, the receiver, and all other intermediate devices need to
  follow. Flow control, access control, addressing, etc. are examples of
  protocol.
