## 2.1 Introduction to Files

We have so far created programs in Python that accept the input, manipulate it
and display the output. But that output is available only during execution of
the program and input is to be entered through the keyboard. This is because the
variables used in a program have a lifetime that lasts till the time the program
is under execution. What if we want to store the data that were input as well as
the generated output permanently so that we can reuse it later? Usually,
organisations would want to permanently store information about employees,
inventory, sales, etc. to avoid repetitive tasks of entering the same data.
Hence, data are stored permanently on secondary storage devices for reusability.
We store Python programs written in script mode with a `.py` extension. Each
program is stored on the secondary device as a file. Likewise, the data entered,
and the output can be stored permanently into a file.

So, what is a file? A file is a named location on a secondary storage media
where data are permanently stored for later access.

:::tip[Do you know?]

Text files contain only the ASCII equivalent of the contents of the file whereas
a .docx file contains many additional information like the author's name, page
settings, font type and size, date of creation and modification, etc.

:::

## 2.2. Types of Files

Computers store every file as a collection of 0s and 1s i.e., in binary form.
Therefore, every file is basically just a series of bytes stored one after the
other. There are mainly two types of data files — text file and binary file. A
text file consists of human readable characters, which can be opened by any text
editor. On the other hand, binary files are made up of non-human readable
characters and symbols, which require specific programs to access its contents.

### 2.2.1 Text File

A text file can be understood as a sequence of characters consisting of
alphabets, numbers and other special symbols. Files with extensions like `.txt`,
`.py`, `.csv`, etc. are some examples of text files. When we open a text file using
a text editor (e.g., Notepad), we see several lines of text. However, the file
contents are not stored in such a way internally. Rather, they are stored in
sequence of bytes consisting of 0s and 1s. In ASCII, UNICODE or any other
encoding scheme, the value of each character of the text file is stored as
bytes. So, while opening a text file, the text editor translates each ASCII
value and shows us the equivalent character that is readable by the human being.
For example, the ASCII value 65 (binary equivalent 1000001) will be displayed by
a text editor as the letter 'A' since the number 65 in ASCII character set
represents 'A'.

Each line of a text file is terminated by a special character, called the End of
Line (`EOL`). For example, the default `EOL` character in Python is the newline
(`\n`). However, other characters can be used to indicate `EOL`. When a text editor
or a program interpreter encounters the ASCII equivalent of the EOL character,
it displays the remaining file contents starting from a new line. Contents in a
text file are usually separated by whitespace, but comma (,) and tab (`\t`) are
also commonly used to separate values in a text file.

:::danger[Activity 2.1]

Create a text file using notepad and write your name and save it. Now, create a
`.docx` file using Microsoft Word and write your name and save it as well. Check
and compare the file size of both the files. You will find that the size of `.txt`
file is in bytes whereas that of `.docx` is in KBs.

:::

### 2.2.2 Binary Files

Binary files are also stored in terms of bytes (0s and 1s), but unlike text
files, these bytes do not represent the ASCII values of characters. Rather, they
represent the actual content such as image, audio, video, compressed versions of
other files, executable files, etc. These files are not human readable. Thus,
trying to open a binary file using a text editor will show some garbage values.
We need specific software to read or write the contents of a binary file.

Binary files are stored in a computer in a sequence of bytes. Even a single bit
change can corrupt the file and make it unreadable to the supporting
application. Also, it is difficult to remove any error which may occur in the
binary file as the stored contents are not human readable. We can read and write
both text and binary files through Python programs.

## 2.3 Opening and Closing a text file

In real world applications, computer programs deal with data coming from
different sources like databases, CSV files, HTML, XML, JSON, etc. We broadly
access files either to write or read data from it. But operations on files
include creating and opening a file, writing data in a file, traversing a file,
reading data from a file and so on. Python has the io module that contains
different functions for handling files.

### 2.3.1 Opening a file

To open a file in Python, we use the `open()` function. The syntax of `open()` is as
follows:

```py
file_object = open(file_name, access_mode)
```

This function returns a file object called file handle which is stored in the
variable `file_object`. We can use this variable to transfer data to and from
the file (read and write) by calling the functions defined in the Python's `io`
module. If the file does not exist, the above statement creates a new empty file
and assigns it the name we specify in the statement.

:::tip[Do you know?]

The `file_object` establishes a link between the program and the data file
stored in the permanent storage

:::

The `file_object` has certain attributes that tells us basic information about
the file, such as:

- `<file.closed>` returns true if the file is closed and false otherwise.

- `<file.mode>` returns the access mode in which the file was opened.
- `<file.name>` returns the name of the file.

The `file_name` should be the name of the file that has to be opened. If the
file is not in the current working directory, then we need to specify the
complete path of the file along with its name.

The `access_mode` is an optional argument that represents the mode in which the
file has to be accessed by the program. It is also referred to as processing
mode. Here mode means the operation for which the file has to be opened like `r`
for reading, `w` for writing, `+` for both reading and writing, `a` for
appending at the end of an existing file. The default is the read mode. In
addition, we can specify whether the file will be handled as binary (`b`) or
text mode. By default, files are opened in text mode that means strings can be
read or written. Files containing non-textual data are opened in binary mode
that means read/write are performed in terms of bytes. Table 2.1 lists various
file access modes that can be used with the `open()` method. The file offset
position in the table refers to the position of the file object when the file is
opened in a particular mode.

:::danger[Activity 2.2]

Some of the other file access modes are `rb+`, `wb`, `w+`, `ab`, `ab+`. Find out
for what purpose each of these are used. Also, find the file offset positions in
each case.

| `w`            | Opens the file in write mode. If the file already exists, all the contents will be overwritten. If the file doesn't exist, then a new file will be created.              | Beginning of the file |
| `wb+` or `+wb` | Opens the file in read, write and binary mode. If the file already exists, the contents will be overwritten. If the file doesn't exist, then a new file will be created. | Beginning of the file |
| `a`            | Opens the file in append mode. If the file doesn't exist, then a new file will be created.                                                                               | End of the file       |
| `a+` or `+a`   | Opens the file in append and read mode. If the file doesn't exist, then it will create a new file.                                                                       | End of the file       |

</IdCard>


Consider the following example.

```py
myObject = open(“myfile.txt”, “a+”)
```

In the above statement, the file `myfile.txt` is opened in append and read
modes. The file object will be at the end of the file. That means we can write
data at the end of the file and at the same time we can also read data from the
file using the file object named `myObject`.

### 2.3.2 Closing a file

Once we are done with the read/write operations on a file, it is a good practice
to close the file. Python provides a `close()` method to do so. While closing a
file, the system frees the memory allocated to it. The syntax of `close()` is:

```py
file_object.close()
```

Here, file_object is the object that was returned while opening the file.

Python makes sure that any unwritten or unsaved data is flushed off (written) to
the file before it is closed. Hence, it is always advised to close the file once
our work is done. Also, if the file object is re-assigned to some other file,
the previous file is automatically closed.

### 2.3.3 Opening a file using with clause

In Python, we can also open a file using `with` clause. The syntax of with
clause is:

```py
with open (file_name, access_mode) as file_object:
```

The advantage of using with clause is that any file that is opened using this
clause is closed automatically, once the control comes outside the with clause.
In case the user forgets to close the file explicitly or if an exception occurs,
the file is closed automatically. Also, it provides a simpler syntax.

```py
with open("myfile.txt","r+") as myObject:
    content = myObject.read()
```

Here, we don't have to close the file explicitly using `close()` statement.
Python will automatically close the file.

## 2.4 Writing to a text File

For writing to a file, we first need to open it in write or append mode. If we
open an existing file in write mode, the previous data will be erased, and the
file object will be positioned at the beginning of the file. On the other hand,
in append mode, new data will be added at the end of the previous data as the
file object is at the end of the file. After opening the file, we can use the
following methods to write data in the file.

- `write()` - for writing a single string
- `writelines()` - for writing a sequence of strings

:::caution[Think and Reflect]

For a newly created file, is there any difference between `write()` and
`append()` methods?

:::

### 2.4.1 The write() method

`write()` method takes a string as an argument and writes it to the text file.
It returns the number of characters being written on single execution of the
`write()` method. Also, we need to add a newline character (`\n`) at the end of
every sentence to mark the end of line.

Consider the following piece of code:

```py
>>> myobject=open("myfile.txt",'w')
>>> myobject.write("Hey I have started using files in Python\n")
41
>>> myobject.close()
```

On execution, write() returns the number of characters written on to the file.
Hence, 41, which is the length of the string passed as an argument, is
displayed.

:::note

`\n` is treated as a single character

:::

If numeric data are to be written to a text file, the data need to be converted
into string before writing to the file. For example:

```py
>>> myobject=open("myfile.txt",'w') 
>>> marks=58 
# number 58 is converted to a string using str() 
>>> myobject.write(str(marks)) 
2 
>>> myobject.close()
```

The `write()` actually writes data onto a buffer. When the `close()` method is
executed, the contents from this buffer are moved to the file located on the
permanent storage.

:::tip[Do you know?]

We can also use the `flush()` method to clear the buffer and write contents in
buffer to the file. This is how programmers can forcefully write to the file as
and when required

:::

### 2.4.2 The writelines() method

This method is used to write multiple strings to a file. We need to pass an
iterable object like lists, tuple, etc. containing strings to the `writelines()`
method. Unlike `write()`, the `writelines()` method does not return the number
of characters written in the file. The following code explains the use of
`writelines()`.

```py
>>> myobject=open("myfile.txt",'w')
>>> lines = ["Hello everyone\n", "Writing multiline strings\n", "This is the third line"]
>>> myobject.writelines(lines)
>>> myobject.close()
```

On opening `myfile.txt`, using notepad, its content will appear as shown in
Figure 2.1.

```txt title="myfile.txt"
Hello everyone
Writing multiline strings
This is the third line
```

_Figure 2.1: Contents of myfile.txt_

:::danger[Activity 2.3]

Run the above code by replacing `writelines()` with `write()` and see what
happens.

:::

:::caution[Think and Reflect]

Can we pass a tuple of numbers as an argument to `writelines()`? Will it be
written to the file or an error will be generated?

:::

## 2.5 Reading from a text File

We can write a program to read the contents of a file. Before reading a file, we
must make sure that the file is opened in `r`, `r+`, `w+` or `a+` mode. There
are three ways to read the contents of a file:

### 2.5.1 The `read()` method

This method is used to read a specified number of bytes of data from a data
file. The syntax of `read()` method is:

```py
file_object.read(n)
```

Consider the following set of statements to understand the usage of `read()`
method:

```py
>>> myobject=open("myfile.txt",'r')
>>> myobject.read(10)
"Hello ever"
>>> myobject.close()
```

If no argument or a negative number is specified in `read()`, the entire file
content is read. For example,

```py
>>> myobject=open("myfile.txt",'r')
>>> print(myobject.read())
Hello everyone
Writing multiline strings
This is the third line
>>> myobject.close()
```

### 2.5.2 The `readline([n])` method

This method reads one complete line from a file where each line terminates with
a newline (`\n`) character. It can also be used to read a specified number (n)
of bytes of data from a file but maximum up to the newline character (`\n`). In
the following example, the second statement reads the first ten characters of
the first line of the text file and displays them on the screen.

```py
>>> myobject=open("myfile.txt",'r')
>>> myobject.readline(10)
'Hello ever'
>>> myobject.close()
```

If no argument or a negative number is specified, it reads a complete line and
returns string.

```py
>>> myobject=open("myfile.txt",'r')
>>> print (myobject.readline())
'Hello everyone\n'
```

To read the entire file line by line using the `readline()`, we can use a loop.
This process is known as looping/ iterating over a file object. It returns an
empty string when `EOF` is reached.

:::danger[Activity 2.4]

Create a file having multiline data and use `readline()` with an iterator to
read the contents of the file line by line

:::

### 2.5.3 The `readlines()` method

The method reads all the lines and returns the lines along with newline as a
list of strings. The following example uses `readlines()` to read data from the
text file `myfile.txt`.

```py
>>> myobject=open("myfile.txt", 'r')
>>> print(myobject.readlines())
['Hello everyone\n', 'Writing multiline
strings\n', 'This is the third line']
>>> myobject.close()
```

As shown in the above output, when we read a file using `readlines()` function,
lines in the file become members of a list, where each list element ends with a
newline character (`\n`).

In case we want to display each word of a line separately as an element of a
list, then we can use `split()` function. The following code demonstrates the
use of `split()` function.

```py
>>> myobject = open("myfile.txt",'r')
>>> d = myobject.readlines()
>>> for line in d:s
        words=line.split()
        print(words)
['Hello', 'everyone']
['Writing', 'multiline', 'strings']
['This', 'is', 'the', 'third', 'line']
```

In the output, each string is returned as elements of a list. However, if
`splitlines()` is used instead of `split()`, then each line is returned as
element of a list, as shown in the output below:

```py
>>> for line in d:
        words=line.splitlines()
        print(words)
['Hello everyone']
['Writing multiline strings']
['This is the third line']
```

Let us now write a program that accepts a string from the user and writes it to
a text file. Thereafter, the same program reads the text file and displays it on
the screen.

import program_21 from './program_2.1.py?raw';
import output_21 from './output_2.1.txt?raw';

<PythonCode
    id="program-21"
    title="Program 2-1 Writing and reading to a text file"
    code={program_21}
	output={output_21}
>

- root
  - program_2.1.py
  - testfile.txt

</PythonCode>

In [Program 2.1](#program-21), the file named `testfile.txt` is opened in write mode and the
file handle named fobject is returned. The string is accepted from the user and
written in the file using `write()`. Then the file is closed and again opened in
read mode. Data is read from the file and displayed till the end of file is
reached.

{/* Output of [Program 2-1](#program-21):

```

``` */}

## 2.6 Setting offsets in a file

The functions that we have learnt till now are used to access the data
sequentially from a file. But if we want to access data in a random fashion,
then Python gives us `seek()` and `tell()` functions to do so.

### 2.6.1 The `tell()` method

This function returns an integer that specifies the current position of the file
object in the file. The position so specified is the byte position from the
beginning of the file till the current position of the file object. The syntax
of using `tell()` is:

```py
file_object.tell()
```

### 2.6.2 The `seek()` method

This method is used to position the file object at a particular position in a
file. The syntax of `seek()` is:

```py
file_object.seek(offset [, reference_point])
```

In the above syntax, offset is the number of bytes by which the file object is
to be moved. `reference_point` indicates the starting position of the file
object. That is, with reference to which position, the offset has to be counted.
It can have any of the following values:

- **0** - beginning of the file
- **1** - current position of the file
- **2** - end of file

By default, the value of `reference_point` is 0, i.e. the offset is counted from
the beginning of the file. For example, the statement `fileObject.seek(5,0)`
will position the file object at 5th byte position from the beginning of the
file. The code in [Program 2-2](#program-22) below demonstrates the usage of `seek()` and
`tell()`.

import program_22 from './program_2.2.py?raw';
import output_22 from './output_2.2.txt?raw';

<PythonCode
    id="program-22"
    title="Program 2-2 Application of seek() and tell()"
    code={program_22}
    output={output_22}            
>

- root
  - program_2.2.py
  - testfile.txt

</PythonCode>

## 2.7 Creating and Traversing a Text File

Having learnt various methods that help us to open and close a file, read and
write data in a text file, find the position of the file object and move the
file object at a desired location, let us now perform some basic operations on a
text file. To perform these operations, let us assume that we will be working
with `practice.txt`.

### 2.7.1 Creating a file and writing data

To create a text file, we use the `open()` method and provide the filename and
the mode. If the file already exists with the same name, the `open()` function
will behave differently depending on the mode (write or append) used. If it is
in write mode (`w`), then all the existing contents of file will be lost, and an
empty file will be created with the same name. But, if the file is created in
append mode (a), then the new data will be written after the existing data. In
both cases, if the file does not exist, then a new empty file will be created.
In [Program 2-3](#program-23), a file, `practice.txt` is opened in write (`w`) mode and three
sentences are stored in it as shown in the output screen that follows it.

import program_23 from './program_2.3.py?raw';
import output_23 from './output_2.3.txt?raw';

<PythonCode
    id="program-23"
    title="Program 2-3 To create a text file and write data in it"
    code={program_23}
    output={output_23}
>

- root
  - program_2.3.py
  - practice.txt

</PythonCode>

### 2.7.2 Traversing a file and displaying data

To read and display data that is stored in a text file, we will refer to the
previous example where we have created the file practice.txt. The file will be
opened in read mode and reading will begin from the beginning of the file.

import program_24 from './program_2.4.py?raw';
import output_24 from './output_2.4.txt?raw';

<PythonCode
    id="program-24"
    title="Program 2-4 To display data from a text file"
    code={program_24}
    output={output_24}
>

- root
  - program_2.4.py
  - practice.txt

</PythonCode>

In [Program 2-4](#program-24), the `readline()` is used in the while loop to read the data line
by line from the text file. The lines are displayed using the `print()`. As the
end of file is reached, the `readline()` will return an empty string. Finally,
the file is closed using the `close()`.

Till now, we have been creating separate programs for writing data to a file and
for reading the file. Now let us create one single program to read and write
data using a single file object. Since both the operations have to be performed
using a single file object, the file will be opened in `w+` mode.

import program_25 from './program_2.5.py?raw';
import output_25 from './output_2.5.txt?raw';

<PythonCode
    id="program-25"
    title="Program 2-5 To perform reading and writing operation in a text file"
    code={program_25}
    output={output_25}
>

- root
  - program_2.5.py
  - report.txt

</PythonCode>


In [Program 2-5](#program-2), the file will be read till the time end of file is not reached
and the output as shown in below is displayed.

## 2.8 The `pickle` module

We know that Python considers everything as an object. So, all data types
including list, tuple, dictionary, etc. are also considered as objects. During
execution of a program, we may require to store current state of variables so
that we can retrieve them later to its present state. Suppose you are playing a
video game, and after some time, you want to close it. So, the program should be
able to store the current state of the game, including current level/stage, your
score, etc. as a Python object. Likewise, you may like to store a Python
dictionary as an object, to be able to retrieve later. To save any object
structure along with data, Python provides a module called `pickle`. The module
`pickle` is used for serializing and de-serializing any Python object structure.
Pickling is a method of preserving food items by placing them in some solution,
which increases the shelf life. In other words, it is a method to store food
items for later consumption.

_**Serialization**_ is the process of transforming data or an object in memory (RAM)
to a stream of bytes called byte streams. These byte streams in a binary file
can then be stored in a disk or in a database or sent through a network.
Serialization process is also called pickling.

_**De-serialization**_ or unpickling is the inverse of pickling process where a byte
stream is converted back to Python object.

The `pickle` module deals with binary files. Here, data are not written but dumped
and similarly, data are not read but loaded. The `pickle` Module must be imported
to load and dump data. The `pickle` module provides two methods - `dump()` and
`load()` to work with binary files for pickling and unpickling, respectively.

### 2.8.1 The `dump()` method

This method is used to convert (pickling) Python objects for writing data in a
binary file. The file in which data are to be dumped, needs to be opened in
binary write mode (`wb`).

Syntax of `dump()` is as follows:

```py
dump(data_object, file_object)
```

where data_object is the object that has to be dumped to the file with the file
handle named `file_object`. For example, [Program 2-6](#program-26) writes the record of a
student (roll_no, name, gender and marks) in the binary file named mybinary.dat
using the `dump()`. We need to close the file after pickling.

import program_26 from './program_2.6.py?raw';

### 2.8.2 The `load()` method

This method is used to load (unpickling) data from a binary file. The file to be
loaded is opened in binary read (`rb`) mode. Syntax of `load()` is as follows:

```py
Store_object = load(file_object)
```

Here, the pickled Python object is loaded from the file having a file handle
named `file_object` and is stored in a new file handle called `store_object`.
The [Program 2-7](#program-27) demonstrates how to read data from the file `mybinary.dat` using
the `load()`.

import program_27 from './program_2.7.py?raw';
import output_27 from './output_2.7.txt?raw';

  - mybinary.dat

</PythonCode>

### 2.8.3 File handling using `pickle` module

As we read and write data in a text file, similarly we will be adding and
displaying data for a binary file. [Program 2-8](#program-28) accepts a record of an employee
from the user and appends it in the binary file tv. Thereafter, the records are
read from the binary file and displayed on the screen using the same object. The
user may enter as many records as they wish to. The program also displays the
size of binary files before starting with the reading process.

import program_28 from './program_2.8.py?raw';
import output_28 from './output_2.8.txt?raw';

<PythonCode
    id="program-28"
    title="Program 2-8 To perform basic operations on a binary file using pickle module"
    code={program_28}
    output={output_28}
>

- root
  - program_2.8.py
  - empfile.dat

</PythonCode>

As each employee record is stored as a list in the file `empfile.dat`, hence
while reading the file, a list is displayed showing record of each employee.
Notice that in [Program 2-8](#program-28), we have also used `try...except` block to handle the
end-of-file exception.

## Summary

:::note[Summary]

- A file is a named location on a secondary storage media where data are
  permanently stored for later access.
- A text file contains only textual information consisting of alphabets, numbers
  and other special symbols. Such files are stored with extensions like `.txt`,
  `.py`, `.c`, `.csv`, `.html`, etc. Each byte of a text file represents a
  character.
- Each line of a text file is stored as a sequence of ASCII equivalent of the
  characters and is terminated by a special character, called the End of Line
  (EOL).
- Binary file consists of data stored as a stream of bytes.
- `open()` method is used to open a file in Python and it returns a file object
  called file handle. The file handle is used to transfer data to and from the
  file by calling the functions defined in the Python's io module.
- `close()` method is used to close the file. While closing a file, the system
  frees up all the resources like processor and memory allocated to it.
- `write()` method takes a string as an argument and writes it to the text file.
- `writelines()` method is used to write multiple strings to a file. We need to
  pass an iterable object like lists, tuple etc. containing strings to
  `writelines()` method.
- `read([n])` method is used to read a specified number of bytes (n) of data
  from a data file.
- `readline([n])` method reads one complete line from a file where lines are
  ending with a newline (\n). It can also be used to read a specified number (n)
  of bytes of data from a file but maximum up to the newline character (\n).
- `readlines()` method reads all the lines and returns the lines along with
  newline character, as a list of strings.
- `tell()` method returns an integer that specifies the current position of the
  file object. The position so specified is the byte position from the beginning
  of the file till the current position of the file object.
- `seek()` method is used to position the file object at a particular position
  in a file.
- Pickling is the process by which a Python object is converted to a byte
  stream.
- `dump()` method is used to write the objects in a binary file.
- `load()` method is used to read data from a binary file.

## Exercise

### Question 1

Differentiate between:

1. text file and binary file
2. `readline()` and `readlines()`
3. `write()` and `writelines()`

### Question 2

Write the use and syntax for the following methods:

1. `open()`
2. `read()`
3. `seek()`
4. `dump()`

### Question 3

Write the file mode that will be used for opening the following files. Also,
write the Python statements to open the following files:

1. a text file `example.txt` in both read and write mode
2. a binary file `bfile.dat` in write mode
3. a text file `try.txt` in append and read mode
4. a binary file `btry.dat` in read only mode.

### Question 4

Why is it advised to close a file after we are done with the read and write
operations? What will happen if we do not close it? Will some error message be
flashed?

### Question 5

What is the difference between the following set of statements (a) and (b):

```py title="a.py"
P = open("practice.txt","r")
P.read(10)
```

```py title="b.py"
with open("practice.txt", "r") as P:
    x = P.read()
```

### Question 6

Write a command(s) to write the following lines to the text file named
`hello.txt`. Assume that the file is opened in append mode.

```txt
Welcome my class
It is a fun place
You will learn and play
```

### Question 7

Write a Python program to open the file hello.txt used in question no 6 in read
mode to display its contents. What will be the difference if the file was opened
in write mode instead of append mode?

### Question 8

Write a program to accept string/sentences from the user till the user enters
**"END"** to. Save the data in a text file and then display only those sentences
which begin with an uppercase alphabet.

### Question 9

Define pickling in Python. Explain serialization and deserialization of Python
object.

### Question 10

Write a program to enter the following records in a binary file:

```txt
Item No integer
Item_Name string
Qty integer
Price float
```

Number of records to be entered should be accepted from the user. Read the file
to display the records in the following format:

```txt
Item No:
Item Name:
Quantity:
Price per item:
Amount: (to be calculated as Price * Qty)
```
