## 6.1 Introduction ||section-6.1||

We store many things in our home and find them out later as and when required.
Sometimes we remember the exact location of a required item. But, sometimes we
do not remember the exact location and in that case we need to search for the
required item. A computer also stores lots of data to be retrieved later as and
when demanded by a user or a program.

Searching means locating a particular element in a collection of elements.
Search result determines whether that particular element is present in the
collection or not. If it is present, we can also find out the position of that
element in the given collection. Searching is an important technique in computer
science. In order to design algorithms, programmers need to understand the
different ways in which a collection of data can be searched for retrieval.

## 6.2 Linear Search ||section-6.2||

Linear search is the most fundamental and the simplest search method. It is an
exhaustive searching technique where every element of a given list is compared
with the item to be searched (usually referred to as 'key'). So, each element in
the list is compared one by one with the key. This process continues until an
element matching the key is found and we declare that the search is successful.
If no element matches the key and we have traversed the entire list, we declare
the search is unsuccessful i.e., the key is not present in the list. This item
by item comparison is done in the order, in which the elements are present in
the list, beginning at the first element of the list and moving towards the
last. Thus, it is also called sequential search or serial search. This technique
is useful for collection of items that are small in size and are unordered.

Given a list `numList` of n elements and key value `K`,
[Algorithm 6.1](#algorithm-6.1) uses a linear search algorithm to find the
position of the key `K` in `numList`.

<Algorithm id="6.1" title="Algorithm 6.1: Linear Search">
  `LinearSearch(numList, key, n)`
  <Steps>
1. SET `index = 0`

2. WHILE `index < n`, REPEAT Step 3

3. IF `numlist[index] = key` THEN
   - PRINT "Element found at position", `index+1`
   - STOP

   ELSE
   - `index = index+1`

4. PRINT "Search unsuccessful"
  </Steps>
</Algorithm>

<Example id="6.1" title="Example 6.1">

Assume that the `numList` has seven elements `[8, -4, 7, 17, 0, 2, 19]` so,
`n = 7`. We need to search for the key, say `17` in `numList`. Table 6.1 shows
the elements in the given list along with their index values. Table 6.1 Elements
in `numList` alongwith their index value

<Table id="6.1" title="Table 6.1">
| Index in `numList` | 0 | 1  | 2 | 3  | 4 | 5 | 6  |
| ------------------ | - | -- | - | -- | - | - | -- |
| Value              | 8 | -4 | 7 | 17 | 0 | 2 | 19 |
</Table>

The step-by-step process of linear search using [Algorithm 6.1](#algorithm-6.1)
is given in [Table 6.2](#table-6.2).

<Table id="6.2" title="Table 6.2 Linear search for key 17 in numList of Table 6.1">
| index | `index < n`   | `numList[index] = key` | `index = index + 1` |
| ----- | ----------- | -------------------- | ----------------- |
| 0     | `0 < 7` ?<br/>Yes | `8 = 17` ?<br/>No           | 1                 |
| 1     | `1 < 7` ?<br/>Yes | `-4 = 17` ?<br/>No          | 2                 |
| 2     | `2 < 7` ?<br/>Yes | `7 = 17` ?<br/>No           | 3                 |
| 3     | `3 < 7` ?<br/>Yes | `17 = 17` ?<br/>Yes         |                   |
</Table>

Observe that after four comparisons, the algorithm found the key 17 and will
display 'Element found at position 4'.

</Example>

<Activity title="Activity 6.1">
Consider a list of 15 elements:

`L=[2,3,9,7,- 6,11,12,17,45,23,29, 31,-37,41,43]`.

Determine the number of comparisons linear search makes to search for `key = 12`.
</Activity>


Let us now assume another arrangement of the elements in `numList` as `[17, 8, -4,
7, 0, 2, 19]` and search for the key `K=17` in `numList`.

<Table id="6.3" title="Table 6.3 Elements in numList alongwith their index value">
| Index in `numList` | 0  | 1 | 2  | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6  |
| ---------------- | -- | - | -- | - | - | - | -- |
| Value            | 17 | 8 | -4 | 7 | 0 | 2 | 19 |
</Table>

<Table id="6.4" title="Table 6.4 Linear search for key 17 in numList given in Table 6.3">
| index | `index < n`   | `numList[index] = key` | `index = index + 1` |
| ----- | ----------- | -------------------- | ----------------- |
| 0     | `0 < 7` ? Yes | `17 = 17` ? Yes         |                   |
</Table>

From [Table 6.4](#table-6.4), it is clear that the algorithm had to make only 1 comparison to
display 'Element found at position 1'. Thus, if the key to be searched is the
first element in the list, the linear search algorithm will always have to make
only 1 comparison. This is the minimum amount of work that the linear search
algorithm would have to do.

Let us now assume another arrangement of the elements in `numList` as `[8, -4, 7,
0, 2, 19, 17]` and search for the key `K = 17` in `numList`.

On a dry run, we can find out that the linear search algorithm has to compare
each element in the list till the end to display 'Element found at position 7'.
Thus, if the key to be searched is the last element in the list, the linear
search algorithm will have to make n comparisons, where n is the number of
elements in the list. This is in fact the maximum amount of work the linear
search algorithm would have to do.

<Activity title="Activity 6.2">

In the list: `L = [7,-1, 11,32,17,19,23,29,31, 37,43]`

Determine the number of comparisons linear search takes to search for `key = 43`.

</Activity>

Let us now assume another case, where the key being searched is not present in
the list. For example, we are searching for key = 10 in the numList.

In this case also, the algorithm has to compare each element in the list till
the end to display 'Element is not found in the list'. Thus, if the key is not
present in the list, the linear search algorithm will have to make n
comparisons. This again is a case where maximum work is done. Let us now
understand the program of a Linear Search. It takes a list of elements and the
key to be searched as input and returns either the position of the element in
the list or display that the key is not present in the list.

## 6.3 Binary Search ||section-6.3||

Consider a scenario where we have to find the meaning of the word Zoology in an
English dictionary. Where do we search it in the dictionary?

1. in the first half?

2. around the middle?

3. in the second half?

It is certainly more prudent to look for the word in the second half of the
dictionary as the word starts with the alphabet 'Z'. On the other hand, if we
were to find the meaning of the word Biology, we would have searched in the
first half of the dictionary.

We were able to decide where to search in the dictionary because we are aware of
the fact that all words in an English dictionary are placed in alphabetical
order. Taking advantage of this, we could avoid unnecessary comparison through
each word beginning from the first word of the dictionary and moving towards the
end till we found the desired word. However, if the words in the dictionary were
not alphabetically arranged, we would have to do linear search to find the
meaning of a word.

The binary search is a search technique that makes use of the ordering of
elements in the list to quickly search a key. For numeric values, the elements
in the list may be arranged either in ascending or descending order of their key
values. For textual data, it may be arranged alphabetically starting from a to z
or from z to a.

In binary search, the key to be searched is compared with the element in the
middle of a sorted list. This could result in either of the three possibilities:

- i) the element at the middle position itself matches the key or
- ii) the element at the middle position is greater than the key or iii) the
  element at the middle position is smaller than the key

If the element at the middle position matches the key, we declare the search
successful and the searching process ends.

If the middle element is greater than the key it means that if the key is
present in the list, it must surely be in the first half. We can thus straight
away ignore the second half of the list and repeat the searching process only in
the first half.

If the middle element is less than the key, it means if the key is present in
the list, it must be in the second half. We can thus straight away ignore the
first half of the list and repeat the searching process only in the second half.
This splitting and reduction in list size continued till the key is either found
or the remaining list consists of only one item. If that item is not the key,
then the search is unsuccessful as the key is not in the list.

Thus, it is evident that unlike linear search of elements one-by-one, we can
search more efficiently using binary search provided the list from which we want
to search is arranged in some order. That is, the list needs to be sorted.

If the list to be searched contains an even number of elements, the mid value is
calculated using the floor division (`//`) operator. If there are 10 elements in
the list, then the middle position (`mid`) = `10//2` = `5`. Therefore, the sixth
element in the list is considered the middle element as we know that the first
element in list has index value 0. If required, the list is further divided into
two parts where the first half contains 5 elements and the second half contains
4 elements.

It is interesting to note that the intermediate comparisons which do not find
the key still give us information about the part of the list where the key may
be found! They reveal whether the key is before or after the current middle
position in the list, and we use this information to narrow down or reduce our
search area. Thus, each unsuccessful comparison reduces the number of elements
remaining to be searched by half, hence the name binary search. Let us now
discuss the algorithm of binary search.

Given a list numList of n elements and key value K, Algorithm 6.2 shows steps
for finding position of the key K in the numList using binary search algorithm.

:::tip

We are using the term iteration and not comparison in binary search, because
after every unsuccessful comparison, we change the search area redefining the
first, mid and last position before making subsequent comparisons.

3. WHILE `first <= last` REPEAT Step 4

4. IF `numList[mid] = key`
   - PRINT "Element found at position", `mid+1`
   - STOP

   ELSE IF `numList[mid] > key`,
   - THEN `last = mid-1`

   ELSE
   - `first = mid + 1`

5. PRINT "Search unsuccessful"
  </Steps>
</Algorithm>

:::tip

The binary search algorithm does not change the list. Rather, after every pass
of the algorithm, the search area gets reduced by half. That is, only the index
of the element to be compared with the key changes in each iteration.

:::

<Example id="6.2" title="Example 6.2">

Consider a sorted list comprising of 15 elements:

`numList = [2,3,5,7,10,11,12,17,19,23,29,31,3 7,41,43]`

We need to search for the key, say 17 in numList. The first, middle and last
element identified in numList alongwith their index values are shown in Table
6.5.

<Table id="6.5" title="Table 6.5 Elements in sorted numList alongwith their index value">
|                  | first |   |   |   |    |    | mid |    |    |    |    |    |    |    | last |

| Value            | 2     | 3 | 5 | 7 | 10 | 11 | 12  | 17 | 19 | 23 | 29 | 31 | 37 | 41 | 43   |
</Table>

|             | first | last | mid |`numList[mid] == K`| `key < Lmid` ?                      | `first <= last` |
| ----------- | ----- | ---- | --- | ----------------- | ----------------------------------- | ------------- |
| At Start    | 0     | 14   | 7   | Not known         | Not known                           | `0 <= 14`? True |
| Iteration 1 | 0     | 14   | 7   | `17 = 17`? Yes      | Key is found. The search terminates |               |
</Table>

</Example>

Note that the algorithm had to make only 1 iteration to display 'Element found
at position 8'. This is because the key being searched is the middle element in
the list. Thus, binary search requires only 1 iteration when the key to be
searched is the middle value in the list. This
is the minimum amount of work binary search would have to do to confirm that a
key is present in the list.

Now, let us search for key 2 in the list.

`numList = [2,3,5,7,10,11,12,17,19,23,29,3 1,37,41,43]`

In the first iteration, we have the mid value as 17. As 2 is smaller than the
mid value (17), we have to search for the first half of the list in the second
iteration. We now consider only 7 elements. As 2 is smaller than the new mid
value (7), we have to search for the first half of the remaining list in the
third iteration. We now consider only 3 elements. Observe that the number of
elements in the numList is halved each time. It reduces from 15 elements in
iteration 1 to 7 elements in iteration 2, and to 3 elements in iteration 3. In
the 3rd iteration, the algorithm finds that key 2 is smaller than the new mid
value (3), we have to search in the first half of the remaining list. The list
now has only 1 element in the fourth iteration and on comparison, it is found
that the element is the same as key. Hence, the search terminates successfully
and returns the position of key. Steps followed for binary search are given in
Table 6.7.

<Table id="6.7" title="Table 6.7 Searching key = 2 in the numList using binary search">
| Iteration   | first | last | mid            | `numList[mid] == K` | `K < numList[mid]`                                           | `first <= last` |
| ----------- | ----- | ---- | ------------   | -----------------   | ----------------------------------------------------------   | ------------- |

| Iteration 1 | 0     | 14   | `(0+14)//2= 7` | `17 = 2`? No        | `2 < 1`7? True                                               | `0 <= 14`? True |
| Iteration 2 | 0     | 6    | `(0+6)//2= 3`  | `7 = 2`? No         | `2 < 7`? True                                                | `0 <= 6`? True  |
| Iteration 3 | 0     | 2    | `(0+2)//2= 1`  | `3 = 2`? No         | `2 < 3`? True                                                | `0 <= 2`? True  |
| Iteration 4 | 0     | 0    | `(0+0)//2= 0`  | `2 = 2`? Yes        | Key found, search terminates, return position as (mid+1)=1   |               |
</Table>

As we can see, the binary search algorithm had to make 4 iterations to narrow
down the list to a single element and decide that the search key is the first
element of list. This is clearly the maximum work required to find a key in the
given list.

### 6.3.1 Applications of Binary Search ||section-6.3.1||

- Binary search has numerous applications including - searching a dictionary or
  a telephone directory, finding the element with minimum value or maximum value
  in a sorted list, etc.
- Modified binary search techniques have far reaching applications such as
  indexing in databases, implementing routing tables in routers, data
  compression code, etc.

## 6.4 Search by Hashing ||section-6.4||

Hashing is a technique which can be used to know the presence of a key in a list
in just one step. The idea is if we already know the value at every index
position in a list, it would require only a single comparison to check the
presence or absence of a key in that list. Hashing makes searching operations
very efficient. A formula called hash function is used to calculate the value at
an index in the list.

:::caution[Think and Reflect]

Suppose a list has more than one element whose modulo division results in same
remainder value. In such situations, what kind of hashing may be useful?

:::

Thus, a hash function takes elements of a list one by one and generates an index
value for every element. This will generate a new list called the hash table.
Each index of the hash table can hold only one item and the positions are
indexed by integer values starting from 0. Note that the size of the hash table
can be larger than the size of the list.

A simple hash function that works with numeric values is known as the remainder
method. It takes an element from a list and divides it by the size of the hash
table. The remainder so generated is called the hash value.

<center>
`h(element) = element % size(hash table)`
</center>

We can easily implement a hash table using a Python's List. Let us consider an
empty hash table having 10 positions as shown in Table 6.8:

<Table id="6.8" title="Table 6.8 An Empty hash table with 10 positions">
| Index/position | 0    | 1    | 2    | 3    | 4    | 5    | 6    | 7    | 8    | 9    |
| -------------- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| Value          | None | None | None | None | None | None | None | None | None | None |
</Table>

Let us consider a list of numbers (34, 16, 2, 93, 80, 77, 51). We can use the
hash function remainder method explained earlier to create a hash table as shown
in [Table 6.9](#table-6.9).

<Table id="6.9" title="Table 6.9 hash function element % 10 applied on the elements of list">
| Element    | 34      | 16      | 2      | 93      | 80      | 77      | 51      |
| ---------- | ------- | ------- | ------ | ------- | ------- | ------- | ------- |
| Hash Value | `34%10=4` | `16%10=6` | `2%10=2` | `93%10=3` | `80%10=0` | `77%10=7` | `51%10=1` |
</Table>

After computing the hash values, each element is inserted at its designated
position in the hash table shown in Table 6.10

<Table id="6.10" title="Table 6.10 hash table generated for elements given in Table 6.10">
| Index | 0  | 1  | 2 | 3  | 4  | 5    | 6  | 7  | 8    | 9    |
| ----- | -- | -- | - | -- | -- | ---- | -- | -- | ---- | ---- |
| Value | 80 | 51 | 2 | 93 | 34 | None | 16 | 77 | None | None |
</Table>

Now, to search for a key, we can calculate its index using the hashing function
and compare the element at that index with the key to declare whether the
element is present in the list or not. This search operation involves just one
comparison and hence the same amount of time is always required to search a key
irrespective of the size of the list.

<Program 
  id="6.3"
  title="Program 6-3 Use of hashing to find a key in the given list L"
  codeFile={import("./res/program_6.3.py?raw")}
  outputFile={import("./res/output_6.3.txt?raw")}
/>

### 6.4.1 Collision ||section-6.4.1||

The hashing technique works fine if each element of the list maps to a unique
location in the hash table. Consider a list [34, 16, 2, 26, 80]. While applying
the hash function say, list [i]%10, two elements (16 and 26) would have a hash
value 6. This is a problematic situation, because according to our definition,
two or more elements cannot be in the same position in the list. This situation
is called collision in hashing.

We must have a mechanism for placing the other items with the same hash value in
the hash table. This process is called collision resolution. Collision can be
resolved in many ways, but it is beyond the scope of this book to discuss
collision resolution methods.

If every item of the list maps to a unique index in the hash table, the hash
function is called a perfect hash function. If a hash function is perfect,
collision will never occur.

Apart from modulo division method, hash functions may be based on several other
techniques like integer division, shift folding, boundary folding, mid-square
function, extraction, radix transformation, etc. Again, it is beyond the scope
of this book to discuss these methods.

The time taken by different hash functions may be different, but it remains
constant for a particular hash function. The advantage of hashing is that the
time required to compute the index value is independent of the number of items
in the search list. It is to remember that the cost of computing a hash function
must be small enough to make a hashing-based searching more efficient than other
search methods.

## Summary

<Summary>
- Searching means trying to locate a particular element called key in a
  collection of elements. Search specifies whether that key is present in the
  collection or not. Also, if the key is present, it tells the position of that
  key in the given collection.

- Linear search checks the elements of a list, one at a time, without skipping
  any element. It is useful when we need to search for an item in a small
  unsorted list, but it is slow and time-consuming when the list contains a
  large number of items. The time taken to search the list increases as the size
  of the list increases.

- Binary search takes a sorted/ordered list and divides it in the middle. It
  then compares the middle element with the key to be searched. If the middle
  element matches the key, the search is declared successful and the program
  ends. If the middle element is greater than the key, the search repeats only
  in the first half of the list. If the middle element is lesser than the key,
  the search repeats only in the second half of the list. This splitting and
  reduction in list size continue till the key is found or the remaining list
  consists of only one item.

- In binary search, comparisons that do not find the key still give us idea
  about the location where the key may probably be found! They reveal whether
  the key is before or after the current middle position in the list, and we can
  use this information to narrow down or reduce our searching efforts.

- Hash based searching requires only one key comparison to discover the presence
  or absence of a key, provided every element is present at its designated
  position decided by a hash function. It calculates the position of the key in
  the list using a formula called the hash function and the key itself.

- When two elements map to the same slot in the hash table, it is called
  collision.

- The process of identifying a slot for the second and further items in the hash
  table in the event of collision, is called collision resolution.

- A perfect hash function maps every input key to a unique index in the hash
  table. If the hash function is perfect, collisions will never occur.
</Summary>

Using linear search determine the position of 8, 1, 99 and 44 in the list:

`[1, -2, 32, 8, 17, 19, 42, 13, 0, 44]`

Draw a detailed table showing the values of the variables and the decisions
taken in each pass of linear search.

### Question 2

Use the linear search program to search the key with value 8 in the list having
duplicate values such as `[42, -2, 32, 8, 17, 19, 42, 13, 8, 44]`. What is the
position returned? What does this mean?

### Question 3

Write a program that takes as input a list having a mix of 10 negative and
positive numbers and a key value.

Apply linear search to find whether the key is present in the list or not. If
the key is present it should display the position of the key in the list
otherwise it should print an appropriate message. Run the program for at least 3
different keys and note the result.

### Question 4

Write a program that takes as input a list of 10 integers and a key value and
applies binary search to find whether the key is present in the list or not. If
the key is present it should display the position of the key in the list
otherwise it should print an appropriate message. Run the program for at least 3
different key values and note the results.

### Question 5

Following is a list of unsorted/unordered numbers:

`[50, 31, 21, 28, 72, 41, 73, 93, 68, 43, 45, 78, 5, 17, 97, 71, 69, 61, 88, 75,
99, 44, 55,9]`

- Use linear search to determine the position of 1, 5, 55 and 99 in the list.
  Also note the number of key comparisons required to find each of these numbers
  in the list.
- Use a Python function to sort/arrange the list in ascending order.
- Again, use linear search to determine the position of 1, 5, 55 and 99 in the
  list and note the number of key comparisons required to find these numbers in
  the list.
- Use binary search to determine the position of 1, 5, 55 and 99 in the sorted
  list. Record the number of iterations required in each case.

### Question 6

Write a program that takes as input the following unsorted list of English
words:

[Perfect, Stupendous, Wondrous, Gorgeous, Awesome, Mirthful, Fabulous, Splendid,
Incredible, Outstanding, Propitious, Remarkable, Stellar, Unbelievable, Super,
Amazing].

- Use linear search to find the position of Amazing, Perfect, Great and Wondrous
  in the list. Also note the number of key comparisons required to find these
  words in the list.
- Use a Python function to sort the list.
- Again, use linear search to determine the position of Amazing, Perfect, Great
  and Wondrous in the list and note the number of key comparisons required to
  find these words in the list.
- Use binary search to determine the position of Amazing, Perfect, Great and
  Wondrous in the sorted list. Record the number of iterations required in each
  case.

### Question 7

Estimate the number of key comparisons required in binary search and linear
search if we need to find the details of a person in a sorted database having
`230 (1,073,741,824)` records when details of the person being searched lies at
the middle position in the database. What do you interpret from your findings?

### Question 8

Use the hash function: `h(element) = element%11` to store the collection of
numbers: `[44, 121, 55, 33, 110, 77, 22, 66]` in a hash table. Display the hash
table created. Search if the values 11, 44, 88 and 121 are present in the hash
table, and display the search results.

### Question 9

Write a Python program by considering a mapping of list of countries and their
capital cities such as:

```py
CountryCapital = {
    "India": "New Delhi",
    "UK": "London",
    "France": "Paris",
    "Switzerland": "Berne",
    "Australia": "Canberra",
}
```

Let us presume that our hash function is the length of the Country Name. Take
two lists of appropriate size: one for keys (Country) and one for values
(Capital). To put an element in the hash table, compute its hash code by
counting the number of characters in Country, then put the key and value in both
the lists at the corresponding indices. For example, India has a hash code of 5.
So, we store India at the 5th position (index 4) in the keys list, and New Delhi
at the 5th position (index 4) in the values list and so on. So that we end up
with:

<Table>
| Hash Index | List of Keys | List of Values |
| ---------- | ------------ | -------------- |
| 0          | None         | None           |
| 1          | UK           | London         |
| 2          | None         | None           |
| 3          | Cuba         | Havana         |
| 4          | India        | New Delhi      |
| 5          | France       | Paris          |
| 6          | None         | None           |
| 7          | None         | None           |
| 8          | Australia    | Canberra       |
| 9          | None         | None           |
| 10         | Switzerland  | Berne          |
</Table>

Now search the capital of India, France and the USA in the hash table and
display your result.
