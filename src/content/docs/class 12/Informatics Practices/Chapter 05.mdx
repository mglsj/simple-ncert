## 5.1 Introduction to Computer Networks ||section-5.1||

We are living in a connected world. Information is being produced, exchanged,
and traced across the globe in real time. It's possible as almost everyone and
everything in the digital world is interconnected through one way or the other.

A group of two or more similar things or people interconnected with each other
is called network ([Figure 5.1](#figure-5.1)). Some of the examples of network in our everyday
life include:

- Social network
- Mobile network
- Network of computers
- Airlines, railway, banks, hospitals networks.

<Figure

  title="Figure 5.1: Interconnection forming a social network"
/>

A computer network ([Figure 5.2](#figure-5.2)) is an interconnection among two or more
computers or computing devices. Such interconnection allows computers to share
data and resources among each other. A basic network may connect a few computers
placed in a room.

The network size may vary from small to large depending on the number of
computers it connects. A computer network can include different types of hosts
(also called nodes) like server, desktop, laptop, cellular phones.

A computer network ([Figure 5.2](#figure-5.2)) is an interconnection among two or more
computers or computing devices. Such interconnection allows computers to share
data and resources among each other. A basic network may connect a few computers
placed in a room.

The network size may vary from small to large depending on the number of
computers it connects. A computer network can include different types of hosts
(also called nodes) like server, desktop, laptop, cellular phones.

<Figure 
  id="5.2"
  title="Figure 5.2: A computer network"
/>

Apart from computers, networks include networking devices like switch, router,
modem, etc. Networking devices are used to connect multiple computers in
different settings. For communication, data in a network is divided into smaller
chunks called packets. These packets are then carried over a network. Devices in
a network can be connected either through wired media like cables or wireless
media like air.

In a communication network, each device that is a part of a network and that can
receive, create, store or send data to different network routes is called a
node. In the context of data communication, a node can be a device such as a
modem, hub, bridge, switch, router, digital telephone handset, a printer, a
computer or a server.

Interconnectivity of computing devices in a network allows us to exchange
information simultaneously with many parties through email, websites,
audio/video calls, etc. Network allows sharing of resources. For example, a
printer can be made available to multiple computers through a network; a
networked storage can be accessed by multiple computers. People often connect
their devices through hotspot, thus forming a small personal network.

## 5.2 Types of Networks ||section-5.2||

There are various types of computer networks ranging from network of handheld
devices (like mobile phones or tablets) connected through Wi-Fi or Bluetooth
within a single room to the millions of computers spread across the globe. Some
are connected wireless while others are connected through wires.

Based on the geographical area covered and data transfer rate, computer networks
are broadly categorised as:

- LAN (Local Area Network)
- MAN (Metropolitan Area Network)
- WAN (Wide Area Network)

### 5.2.1 Local Area Network (LAN) ||section-5.2.1||

It is a network that connects computers, mobile phones, tablet, mouse, printer,
etc., placed at a limited distance. The geographical area covered by a LAN can
range from a single room, a floor, an office having one or more buildings in the
same premise, laboratory, a school, college, or university campus. The
connectivity is done by means of wires, Ethernet cables, fibre optics, or Wi-Fi.
A Local Area Network (LAN) is shown in [Figure 5.3](#figure-5.3).

<Figure 
  id="5.3"
  title="Figure 5.3: A Local Area Network"
/>

LAN is comparatively secure as only authentic users in the network can access
other computers or shared resources. Users can print documents using a connected
printer, upload or download documents and software to and from the local server.
Such LANs provide the short range communication with the high speed data
transfer rates. These types of networks can be extended up to 1 km. Data
transfer in LAN is quite high, and usually varies from 10 Mbps (called Ethernet)
to 1000 Mbps (called Gigabit Ethernet), where Mbps stands for Megabits per
second. Ethernet is a set of rules that decides how computers and other devices
connect with each other through cables in a local area network or LAN.

### 5.2.2 Metropolitan Area Network (MAN) ||section-5.2.2||

Metropolitan Area Network (MAN) is an extended form of LAN which covers a larger
geographical area like a city or a town. Data transfer rate in MAN also ranges
in Mbps, but it is considerably less as compared to LAN. Cable TV network or
cable based broadband internet services are examples of MAN. This kind of
network can be extended up to 30-40 km. Sometimes, many LANs are connected
together to form MAN, as shown in [Figure 5.4](#figure-5.4).

<Figure 
  id="5.4"
  title="Figure 5.4: A Metropolitan Area Network"
/>

### 5.2.3 Wide Area Network (WAN) ||section-5.2.3||

Wide Area Network (WAN) connects computers and others LANs and MANs, which are
spread across different geographical locations of a country or in different
countries or continents. A WAN could be formed by connecting a LAN to other LANs
([Figure 5.5](#figure-5.5)) via wired or wireless media. Large business, educational and
government organisations connect their different branches in different locations
across the world through WAN. The Internet is the largest WAN that connects
billions of computers, smartphones and millions of LANs from different
continents.

## 5.3 network devIces ||section-5.3||

To communicate data through different transmission media and to configure
networks with different functionality, we require different devices like Modem,
Hub, Switch, Repeater, Router, Gateway, etc. Let us explore them in detail.

### 5.3.1 Modem ||section-5.3.1||

Modem stands for 'MOdulator DEMolulator'. It refers to a device used for
conversion between analog signals and digital bits. We know computers store and
process data in terms of 0s and 1s. However, to transmit data from a sender to a
receiver, or while browsing the internet, digital data are converted to an
analog signal and the medium (be it free-space or a physical media) carries the
signal to the receiver. There are modems connected to both the source and
destination nodes. The modem at the sender's end acts as a modulator that
converts the digital data into analog signals. The modem at the receiver's end
acts as a demodulator that converts the analog signals into digital data for the
destination node to understand. [Figure 5.6](#figure-5.6) shows connectivity using a modem.

<Figure
  id="5.6"
  title="Figure 5.6: Use of modem"
/>

### 5.3.2 Ethernet Card ||section-5.3.2||

Ethernet card, also known as Network Interface Card (NIC card in short) is a
network adaptor used to set up a wired network. It acts as an interface between
computer and the network. It is a circuit board mounted on the motherboard of a
computer as shown in [Figure 5.7](#figure-5.7). The Ethernet cable connects the computer to the
network through NIC. Ethernet cards can support data transfer between 10 Mbps
and 1 Gbps (1000 Mbps). Each NIC has a MAC address, which helps in uniquely
identifying the computer on the network.

<Figure
  id="5.7"
  title="Figure 5.7: A Network Interface Card"
/>

### 5.3.3 Repeater ||section-5.3.3||

Data are carried in the form of signals over the cable. These signals can travel
a specified distance (usually about 100 m). Signals lose their strength beyond
this limit and become weak. In such conditions, original signals need to be
regenerated.

A repeater is an analog device that works with signals on the cables to which it
is connected. The weakened signal appearing on the cable is regenerated and put
back on the cable by a repeater.

### 5.3.4 Hub ||section-5.3.4||

An Ethernet hub ([Figure 5.8](#figure-5.8)) is a network device used to connect different
devices through wires. Data arriving on any of the lines are sent out on all the
others. The limitation of hub is that if data from two devices come at the same
time, they will collide.

<Figure
  id="5.8"
  title="Figure 5.8: A network hub with 8 ports"
/>

### 5.3.5 Switch ||section-5.3.5||

A switch is a networking device ([Figure 5.9](#figure-5.9)) that plays a central role in a
Local Area Network (LAN). Like a hub, a network switch is used to connect
multiple computers or communicating devices. When data arrives, the switch
extracts the destination address from the data packet and looks it up in a table
to see where to send the packet. Thus it sends signals to only selected devices
instead of sending to all. It can forward multiple packets at the same time. A
switch does not forward the signals which are noisy or corrupted. It drops such
signals and asks the sender to resend it.

<Figure
  id="5.9"
  title="Figure 5.9: Cables connected to a network switch"
/>

Ethernet switches are common in homes and offices to connect multiple devices,
thus creating LANs or to access the Internet.

### 5.3.6 Router ||section-5.3.6||

A router ([Figure 5.10](#figure-5.10)) is a network device that can receive the data, analyse it
and transmit it to other networks. A router connects a local area network to the
internet. Compared to a hub or a switch, a router has advanced capabilities as
it can analyse the data being carried over a network, decide or alter how it is
packaged, and send it to another network of a different type. For example, data
has been divided into packets of a certain size. Suppose, these packets are to
be carried over a different type of network which cannot handle bigger packets,
in such a case, the data is to be repackaged as smaller packets and then sent
over the network by a router.

<Figure
  id="5.10"
  title="Figure 5.10: A Router"
/>

A router can be wired or wireless. A wireless router can provide Wi-Fi access to
smartphones and other devices. Usually, such routers also contain some ports to
provide wired Internet access. These days, home Wi-Fi routers perform the dual
task of a router and a modem or switch. These routers connect to incoming
broadband lines, from ISP (Internet Service Provider), and convert them to
digital data for computing devices to process.

### 5.3.7 Gateway ||section-5.3.7||

As the term "Gateway" suggests, it is a key access point that acts as a "gate"
between an organisation's network and the outside world of the Internet ([Figure
5.11](#figure-5.11)). Gateway serves as the entry and exit point of a network, as all data
coming in or going out of a network must first pass through the gateway in order
to use routing paths. Besides routing data packets, gateways also maintain
information about the host network's internal connection paths and the
identified paths of other remote networks. If a node from one network wants to
communicate with a node of a foreign network, it will pass the data packet to
the gateway, which then routes it to the destination using the best possible
route.

For simple Internet connectivity at homes, the gateway is usually the Internet
Service Provider that provides access to the entire Internet. Generally, a
router is configured to work as a gateway device in computer networks. A gateway
can be implemented as software, hardware, or a combination of both. This is
because a network gateway is placed at the edge of a network and the firewall is
usually integrated with it.

## 5.4 Networking Topologies ||section-5.4||

We have already discussed that a number of computing devices are connected
together to form a Local Area Network (LAN), and interconnections among millions
of LANs forms the Internet. The arrangement of computers and other peripherals
in a network is called its topology. Common network topologies are mesh, ring,
bus, star and tree.

### 5.4.1 Mesh Topology ||section-5.4.1||

In this networking topology, each communicating device is connected with every
other device in the network as shown in [Figure 5.12](#figure-5.12). Such a network can handle
large amounts of traffic since multiple nodes can transmit data simultaneously.
Also, such networks are more reliable in the sense that even if a node gets
down, it does not cause any break in the transmission of data between other
nodes. This topology is also more secure as compared to other topologies because
each cable between two nodes carries different data. However, wiring is complex
and cabling cost is high in creating such networks, and there are many redundant
or unutilised connections.

<Figure
  id="5.12"
  title="Figure 5.12: A mesh topology"
/>

:::tip

To build a fully- connected mesh topology of $n$ nodes, it requires 
$\frac{n(n-1)}{2}$ wires.

:::

### 5.4.2 Ring Topology ||section-5.4.2||

In ring topology, each node is connected to two other devices, one each on
either side, as shown in [Figure 5.13](#figure-5.13). The nodes connected with each other thus
form a ring. The link in a ring topology is unidirectional. Thus, data can be
transmitted in one direction only (clockwise or counterclockwise).

<Figure
  id="5.13"
  title="Figure 5.13: A ring topology"
/>

### 5.4.3 Bus Topology ||section-5.4.3||

In bus topology ([Figure 5.14](#figure-5.14)), each communicating device connects to a
transmission medium, known as bus. Data sent from a node are passed on to the
bus and hence are transmitted to the length of the bus in both directions. That
means data can be received by any of the nodes connected to the bus.

<Figure
  id="5.14"
  title="Figure 5.14: A bus topology"
/>

In this topology, a single backbone wire called bus is shared among the nodes,
which makes it cheaper and easy to maintain. Both ring and bus topologies are
considered to be less secure and less reliable.

<Think title="Think and Reflect">
How will a bus and ring topology behave in case a node is down?
</Think>

### 5.4.4 Star Topology ||section-5.4.4||

In star topology, each communicating device is connected to a central node,
which is a networking device like a hub or a switch, as shown in [Figure 5.15](#figure-5.15).

Star topology is considered very effective, efficient and fast as each device is
directly connected with the central device. Although disturbance in one device
will not affect the rest of the network, any failure in the central networking
device may lead to the failure of complete network.

<Figure
  id="5.15"
  title="Figure 5.15: A star topology"
/>

The central node can be either a broadcasting device means data will be
transmitted to all the nodes in the network, or a unicast device means the node
can identify the destination and forward data to that node only.

### 5.4.5 Tree or Hybrid Topology ||section-5.4.5||

It is a hierarchical topology, in which there are multiple branches and each
branch can have one or more basic topologies like star, ring and bus. Such
topologies are usually realised in WANs where multiple LANs are connected. Those
LANs may be in the form of ring, bus or star. In [Figure 5.16](#figure-5.16), a hybrid topology
is shown connecting 4 star topologies in bus.

In this type of network, data transmitted from source first reaches the
centralised device and from there the data passes through

<Figure
  id="5.16"
  title="Figure 5.16: A hybrid topology every branch where each branch can have link for more nodes."
/>

## 5.5 The Internet ||section-5.5||

The Internet is the global network of computing devices including desktop,
laptop, servers, tablets, mobile phones, other handheld devices as well as
peripheral devices such as printers, scanners, etc. In addition, it also
consists of networking devices such as routers, switches, gateways, etc. Today,
smart electronic appliances like TV, AC, refrigerator, fan, light, etc., can
also communicate through the Internet. The list of such smart devices are always
increasing e.g., drones, vehicles, door lock, security camera, etc.

The Internet is evolving everyday. Computers are either connected to a modem
through a cable or wirelessly (Wi-Fi). A modem, be it wired or wireless, is
connected to a local Internet Service Provider (ISP) who then connects to a
national network. Many such ISPs connect together forming a regional network and
regional networks connect together forming a national network, and such
country-wise networks form the Internet backbone.

The Internet today is a widespread network, and its influence is no longer
limited to the technical fields of computer communications. It is being used by
everyone in the society as is evident from the increasing use of online tools
for education, creativity, entertainment, socialisation and e-commerce.

## 5.6 ApplIcAtIons of Internet ||section-5.6||

Following are some of the broad areas or services provided through Internet:

- The World Wide Web (WWW)
- Electronic mail (Email)
- Chat
- Voice Over Internet Protocol (VoIP)

### 5.6.1 The World Wide Web (WWW) ||section-5.6.1||

The World Wide Web (WWW) or web in short, is an ocean of information, stored in
the form of trillions of interlinked web pages and web resources. The resources
on the web can be shared or accessed through the Internet.

Earlier, to access files residing in different computers, one had to login
individually to each computer through the Internet. Besides, files in different
computers were sometimes in different formats, and it was difficult to
understand each other's files and documents. Sir Tim Berners-Lee — a British
computer scientist invented the revolutionary World Wide Web in 1990 by defining
three fundamental technologies that lead to creation of web:

- **HTML —** HyperText Markup Language or HTML is a language which is used to
  design standardised Web Pages so that the Web contents can be read and
  understood from any computer across the globe. It uses tags to define the way
  page content should be displayed by the web browser. Basic structure of every
  webpage is designed using HTML.

- **URI —** Uniform Resource Identifier or URI is a unique identifier to
  identify a resource located on the web. URI identifies a resource (hardware or
  software) either by its location or by its name or by both.

  URL is Uniform Resource Locator and provides the location and mechanism
  (protocol) to access the resource. Examples of URI identifying resources using
  location (i.e., URL) are: https://www.mhrd.gov.in, https://www.ncert.nic.in,
  https://www.airindia.in, etc. URL is sometimes also called a web address.
  However, it is not only the domain name, but contains other information that
  completes a web address, as depicted below:

  $$
  \textcolor{blue}
  {
      \underbrace{
          http://
          \textcolor{red}{
              \overbrace{www.ncert.nic.in}
              ^{\text{Domain Name}}
          }
          /textbook/textbook.htm
      }
      _{\text{URL}}
  }
  $$

  In the above URL, http is the protocol name, it can be https, http, FTP,
  Telnet, etc. www is a subdomain. ncert.nic.in is the domain name.

  :::note

  These days it is not mandatory to mention protocol and subdomain while
  entering a URL. The browser automatically prefixes it.

  :::

  :::tip

  Search Engine(s) like [google.co.in](https://google.co.in),
  [bing.com](https://bing.com), [duckduckgo.com](https://duckduckgo.com),
  [in.yahoo.com](https://in.yahoo.com), etc., can be used to search and retrieve
  information when the address of the web page is not known.

  :::

- **HTTP —** The HyperText Transfer Protocol is a set of rules which is used to
  retrieve linked web pages across the web. It's more secure and advanced
  version is HTTPS.

Many people confuse the web with the Internet. The Internet as we know is the
huge global network of interconnected computers, which may or may not have any
file or webpage to share with the world.

The web on the other hand is the interlinking of a collection of WebPages on
these computers which are accessible over the Internet. WWW today gives users
access to a vast collection of information created and shared by people across
the world. It is today the most popular information retrieval system.

### 5.6.2 Electronic Mail (Email) ||section-5.6.2||

Email is the short form of electronic mail. It is one of the ways of sending and
receiving message(s) using the Internet. An email can be sent anytime to any
number of recipients at anywhere. The message can be either text entered
directly onto the email application or an attached file (text, image audio,
video, etc.) stored on a secondary storage. An existing file can be sent as an
attachment with the email, so no need to type it again.

To use email service, one needs to register with an email service provider by
creating a mail account. These services may be free or paid. Some of the popular
email service providers are Google (gmail), Yahoo (yahoo mail), Microsoft
(outlook), etc. However, many organisations nowadays get customised business
email addresses for their staff using their own domain name. For example,
`username@companyname.com`.

Following are some of the common facilities available for an email user:

1. Creating an email, attaching files with an email, saving an email as draft
   for mailing later. Creating email is also termed as composing.

2. Sending and receiving mail. Same email can be sent to multiple email
   addresses, simultaneously.

3. Sending the copy of mail, as carbon copy (cc) or blind carbon copy (bcc).

4. Forwarding a received email to other user(s)

5. Filtering spam emails

6. Organising email in folders and sub folders

7. Creating and managing email ids of the people you know.

8. Setting signature/footer to be inserted automatically at the end of each
   email

9. Printing emails using a printer or saving as files.

10. Searching emails using email address or email subject text

### 5.6.3 Chat ||section-5.6.3||

Chatting or Instant Messaging (IM) over the Internet means communicating to
people at different geographic locations in real time through text message(s).
It is a forum where multiple people connect to each other, to discuss their
common interests. Two individuals can also send messages instantly. The sender
types a message and sends it; the receiver immediately receives the message and
can read and revert through text message. All this happens in real time, as if
the sender and receiver were sitting in the same place. For a successful chat
session, the communicating parties should be online simultaneously, and use the
same chat application.

With ever increasing internet speed, it is now possible to send image, document,
audio, video as well through instant messengers. It means, the communicating
parties can talk to each other through an audio call or through a video call.
Moreover, it is also possible to chat through text, audio and video in a group.
Thus, we can have group chat or group calls.

Applications such as WhatsApp, Slack, Skype, Yahoo Messenger, Google Talk,
Facebook Messenger, Google Hangout, etc., are examples of instant messengers.
Some of these applications support instant messaging through all the modes —
text, audio and video.

### 5.6.4 VoIP ||section-5.6.4||

Voice over Internet Protocol or VoIP, allows us to have voice call (telephone
service) over the Internet, i.e., the voice transmission over a computer network
rather than through the regular telephone network. It is also known as Internet
Telephony or Broadband Telephony. But to avail the phone service over the
Internet, we need to have an Internet connection with reasonably good speed.

VoIP works on the simple principle of converting the analogue voice signals into
digital and then transmitting them over the broadband line. There are two major
advantages of a VoIP—

- These services are either free or very economical, so people use them to save
  on cost. That is why these days even international calls are being made using
  VoIP.
- VoIP call(s) can be received and made using IP phones from any place having
  Internet access. Hence, VoIP has increased the portability and functionality
  of the voice calling system. Incoming phone calls can be automatically routed
  to the VoIP phone as soon as it is connected to the Internet.

The only disadvantage of VoIP is that its call quality is dependent on Internet
connection speed. Slow Internet connection will lead to poor quality voice
calls.

## 5.7 WEBSITE ||section-5.7||

Each one of us might have visited one or the other website. A website in general
contains information organised in multiple pages about an organisation. A
website can also be created for a particular purpose, theme or to provide a
service.

A website (usually referred to as a site in short) is a collection of web pages
related through hyperlinks, and saved on a web server. A visitor navigates from
one page to another by clicking on hyperlinks. Also, all the pages of a website
are integrated under one domain name and have a common theme and template. For
example, the website of NCERT will have all the pages related to NCERT, viz.,
textbooks, syllabus, events, resource materials, etc., under one domain name and
having a common design theme. To access a website, one has to type the address
of the website (URL) in the address bar of a browser, and press enter. The home
page of the website will be displayed.

### 5.7.1 Purpose of a Website ||section-5.7.1||

We are living in an Internet era where the whole world is connected. A website's
purpose is to make the information available to people at large. For example, a
company might like to advertise or sell its products, a government organisation
may like to publish circulars, float tenders, invite applications or get
feedback from various stakeholders. A website is a means that helps to
communicate with people in a specific, transparent and user friendly manner.
Therefore, while developing a website, the first question to ask is why the
website is being created, and what should be its pages so that it serves the
required purpose.

Basically, a website should be user friendly and provide information to users
with minimum efforts. A website should be designed keeping in mind different
categories of people that will be visiting the site. Some of the common purposes
for which websites are designed are listed below:

- Selling products and delivering services
- Posting and finding information on the internet
- Communicating with each other
- Entertainment purposes
- Disseminating contents and software

<Activity id="5.4" title="Activity 5.4">
Visit NCERT, SWAYAM or any other website and note down URLs of some of the
specific pages of that website.
</Activity>

## 5.8 WEB PAGE ||section-5.8||

A web page (also referred to as a page) is a document on the WWW that is viewed
in a web browser. Basic structure of a web page is created using HTML (HyperText
Markup Language) and CSS (Cascaded Style Sheet). A web page is usually a part of
a website and may contain information in different forms, such as:

- text in the form of paragraphs, lists, tables, etc.
- images
- audio
- video
- software application
- other interactive contents

Additionally, various styling and formatting are applied on a web page to make
it attractive and organised. Further, program codes called scripts are used to
define the manner in which the page will behave on different actions. Scripts
make a web page interactive. JavaScript is the most popular and commonly used
scripting language. However, Python and PHP are also used to apply scripting on
a web page.

The first page of the website is called a home page. It generally contains
information and links to all the related web pages. Each web page has a unique
address that is visible on the address bar. Hence if we want to view a
particular web page, its address has to be typed in the address bar of the
browser. The web pages that are linked to form a website share a unique domain
name. For example, https://swayam.gov.in/ is a website by the Government of
India to deliver online courses for School, College and University students and
teachers. It is a collection of multiple web pages that link to different
courses related information.

### 5.8.1 Static and Dynamic Web Pages ||section-5.8.1||

A web page can be static or dynamic. A static webpage is one whose content
always remains static, i.e., does not change for person to person. When a web
server receives a request (from browser) for a static web page, it just locates
the page on its storage media and sends it to the browser of the client. No
additional processing is performed on the page. Hence, a static web page remains
the same for all users until someone changes its code manually.

Static web pages are generally written in HTML, JavaScript and/or CSS and have
the extension .htm or .html.

<Figure 
  id="5.17" 
  title="Figure 5.17: Working of a static web page" 
/>

On the other hand, a dynamic web page is one in which the content of the web
page can be different for different users. The difference in content may be
because of different choices made by the user. When a request for a dynamic web
page is made to the web server, it does not simply retrieve the page and send.
Before sending the requested web page, the server may perform some additional
processes like getting information from the database, updating date and time,
updating weather information, etc. The content of such pages changes frequently.
They are more complex and thus take more time to load than static web pages.

Dynamic web pages can be created using various languages such as JavaScript,
PHP, ASP.NET, Python, Java, Ruby, etc. These are complex to construct and
design, as the code to perform the additional operations has to be added. Such
server side code allows the server to change its content each time the page is
loaded. Further, most dynamic pages are linked to databases so that each time
the page is uploaded, the required information from the databases is retrieved
to update the web page. Few common examples of dynamic web pages are those web
pages displaying the date, time, and weather report or having e-commerce
applications.

## 5.9 web server ||section-5.9||

A web server is used to store and deliver the contents of a website to clients
such as a browser that request it. A web server can be software or hardware.

When talking about a web server as computer hardware, it stores web server
software and a website's contents (HTML pages, images, CSS stylesheets, and
JavaScript files). The server needs to be connected to the Internet so that its
contents can be made accessible to others.

When talking about a web server as a software, it is a specialised program that
understands URLs or web addresses coming as requests from browsers, and responds
to those requests. The server is assigned a unique domain name so that it can be
accessed from anywhere using the domain name. To develop and test a website
using a personal computer, we need to first install a web server on that
computer.

The web browser from the client computer sends a request (HTTP request) for a
page containing the desired data or service. The web server then accepts,
interprets, searches and responds (HTTP response) to the request made by the web
browser. The requested web page is then displayed in the browser of the client.
If the server is not able to locate the page, it sends a page containing the
error message (Error 404 - page not found) to the client's browser.

## 5.10 Hosting of a Website ||section-5.10||

Web hosting is a service that allows us to put a website or a web page onto the
Internet, and make it a part of the World Wide Web. Once a website is created
using a hardware server, we need to connect it to the Internet so that users
across the globe can access. On the other hand, we can rent server resources
(CPU, RAM, and storage) from a cloud service provider and host our locally
created website there. This is done by uploading the files constituting the
website (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, images, databases, etc.) from the local computer
onto the space allocated on the server. For this, we have to avail the services
of a web hosting service provider. These services for using the server's
resources such as RAM, hard disk, bandwidth, etc., are usually paid and these
resources can be increased or decreased as per the loads on the website.

A web server whether it is a local server or a cloud server when connected to
the Internet is assigned a unique numeric address on the Internet called IP
address. This IP address needs to be mapped to a textual name called domain name
of the website. This is because it is not convenient for users to remember a
numeric IP address. Thus, for accessing a website, the user enters the domain
through a browser (URL). The domain name has to be registered (purchased) with
an authorised agency.

### 5.10.1 How to host a website? ||section-5.10.1||

To host a website, follow the steps given below:

- Select the web hosting service provider that will provide the web server space
  as well as related technologies and services such as database, bandwidth, data
  backup, firewall support, email service, etc. This has to be done keeping in
  mind the features and services that we want to offer through our website.

- Identify a domain name, which best suits our requirement, and get it
  registered through domain name Registrar.

- Once we get web space, create logins with appropriate rights and note down IP
  address to manage web space.

- Upload the files in properly organised folders on the allocated space.

- Get domain name mapped to the IP address of the web server.

The domain name system (DNS) is a service that does the mapping between domain
name and IP address. When the address of a website is entered in a browser, the
DNS finds out the IP address of the server corresponding to the requested domain
name and sends the request to that server.

## 5.11 Browser ||section-5.11||

A browser is a software application that helps us to view the web page(s). In
other words, it helps us to view the data or information that is retrieved from
various web servers on the Internet. Some of the commonly used web browsers are
Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge (Internet Explorer), Mozilla Firefox, Opera, etc.
A web browser essentially displays the HTML documents which may include text,
images, audio, video and hyperlinks that help to navigate from one web page to
another.

first web browser developed by the National Centre for Supercomputing
Application (NCSA).

:::

The initial web browsers like Mosaic used to support HTML documents containing
plain text (static website) only, but nowadays with the advancement of
technology, modern web browsers allow us to view interactive and dynamic
websites. In addition to this, most modern browsers allow a wide range of visual
effects, use encryption for advanced security and also have cookies that can
store the browser settings and data.

### 5.11.1 Browser Settings

:::tip

Mozilla Firefox is an open source web browser which is available free of cost
and can be easily downloaded from the Internet.

:::

Every web browser has got certain settings that define the manner in which the
browser will behave. These settings may be with respect to privacy, search
engine preferences, download options, auto signature, autofill and autocomplete
feature, theme and much more. Each browser application allows us to change or
customise its settings in a user friendly manner. Let's learn how to change the
browser settings using the open source browser, Mozilla Firefox.

Open Mozilla Firefox, and on the top right corner of the browser window, click
the Menu button.

<Figure 
  id="5.20" 
  title="Figure 5.20: Mozilla Firefox Menu button" 
  images={[
    {
      src: import("./res/fig_5.20.png"),
      srcDark: import("./res/fig_5.20.dark.png"),
      alt: "Mozilla Firefox Menu button"
    }
  ]}
/>

From the drop down button, select Options. The preferences and Options window
will be displayed in the browser.

<Figure 
  id="5.21" 
  title="Figure 5.21: Preference and options page"
  images={[
    {
      src: import("./res/fig_5.21.png"),
      srcDark: import("./res/fig_5.21.dark.png"),
      alt: "Preference and options page"
    }
  ]}
/>

On the left side, there are multiple Panels to choose from: General, Home,
Search, Privacy and Security and Sync.

**General Panel:** Some of the options that the panel contains are as follows:

- setting the default browser
- language and appearance of text
- downloading files and applications
- firefox update settings
- browsing and network settings

**Home Panel:** This panel contains options to set the home page of the browser,
browser window and tab settings.

**Search Panel:** This panel contains options to edit the settings of the search
engine used by Firefox. Privacy and Security Panel: This panel contains options
to secure the browser and data. It includes the following:

- enhanced tracking protection
- forms and passwords
- history and address bar
- cookies and site data
- permission to view pop ups windows and install add- ons

**Sync Panel:** This panel contains options to set up and manage a Firefox
account which is needed to access all services given by Mozilla.

Make the desired settings and close the browser settings window. The changes
made in the browser settings will be applied.

### 5.11.2 Add-Ons and Plug-ins ||section-5.11.2||

Add-ons and plug-ins are the tools that help to extend and modify the
functionality of the browser. Both the tools boost the performance of the
browser, but are different from each other.

A plug-in is a complete program or may be a third-party software. For example,
Flash and Java are plug-ins. A Flash player is required to play a video in the
browser. A plug-in is a software that is installed on the host computer and can
be used by the browser for multiple functionalities and can even be used by
other applications as well.

On the other hand, an add-on is not a complete program and so is used to add
only a particular functionality to the browser. An add-on is also referred to as
extension in some browsers. Adding the functionality of a sound and graphics
card is an example of an add-on.

<Figure 
  id="5.22" 
  title="Figure 5.22: Add-ons and plug-ins"
  images={[
    {
      src: import("./res/fig_5.22.png"),
      srcDark: import("./res/fig_5.22.dark.png"),
      alt: "Add-ons and plug-ins"
    }
  ]}
/>

To add an extension, click the Options button on the top right corner of the
browser and select the Add- ons option. Click the Extensions Panel option on the
left. On the right, options to Manage your Extensions will appear. There will be
a list of enabled, disabled and recommended extensions. Make the desired
selections and close the add-ons window.

Similarly, to add plug-ins, click Plug-ins options on the left side of the
browser window. Make the desired selections to enable or disable the required
plug-ins.

<Think title="Think and Reflect">
Can we compare Add-ons and Plug-ins with utility software?

### 5.11.3 Cookies ||section-5.11.3||

A cookie is a text file, containing a string of information, which is
transferred by the website to the browser when we browse it. This string of
information gets stored in the form of a text file in the browser. The
information stored is retransmitted to the server to recognise the user, by
identifying pages that were visited, choices that were made while browsing
various menu(s) on a particular website. It helps in customising the information
that will be displayed, for example the choice of language for browsing,
allowing the user to auto login, remembering the shopping preference, displaying
advertisements of one's interest, etc.

Cookies are usually harmless and they can't access information from the hard
disk of a user or transmit virus or malware. It is the browser on our computer
which stores and manages the cookies. However, viruses can also be tricked as
cookies and cause harm to a computer. One can disable cookies by changing the
Privacy and Security settings of our browser.

:::tip

First cookie software was created in 1994 at Netscape, for determining whether
the person is a first time visitor or a re-visitor of their site.

  transmit to other networks.

- A gateway is a device that connects the organisation's network with the
  outside world of the Internet.

- The physical organisation of computers, cables and other peripherals in a
  network is called its topology. Common network topologies are Bus, Star, Tree,
  Mesh, etc.

- In bus topology, each communicating device connects to a common central
  transmission medium, known as bus.

- In star topology, each communicating device is connected to a central node,
  which is a networking device like a hub or a switch, through separate cables.
  notes

- In tree topology, multiple star and bus topologies are connected to a central
  cable, also called the backbone of the network.

- In mesh topology, each communicating device is connected with every other
  device in the network.

- The Internet is the largest WAN that connects millions of computers across the
  globe.

- Some of the services provided through the Internet are information sharing,
  communication, data transfer, social networking, e-commerce, etc.

- A Uniform Resource Locator (URL) is a standard naming convention used for
  accessing resources over the Internet.

- Electronic mail is a means of sending and receiving message(s) through the
  Internet.

- Chatting is communicating in real time using text message(s).

- Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) allows you to have voice calls over
  digital networks.

- A website is a collection of related web pages.

- A web page is a document that is viewed in a web browser such as Google
  Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Opera, Internet Explorer, etc. It can be static or
  dynamic.

- A static web page is one whose content does not change for requests made by
  different people.

- A dynamic web page is one in which the content of the web page displayed is
  different for different users.

- A web server is a program or a computer that provides services to other
  programs or computers called clients.

- Web hosting is a service that allows you to post the website created locally
  so that it is available for all internet users across the globe.

- Every browser has got certain settings that define the manner in which the
  browser will behave. These settings may be with respect to privacy, search
  engine preferences, download options, auto signature, autofill and
  autocomplete feature and much more.
