## 4.1 Introduction ||section-4.1||

We have learned how to organise and analyse data and perform various statistical
operations on Pandas DataFrames. Likewise, in Class XI, we have learned how to
analyse numerical data using NumPy. The results obtained after analysis is used
to make inferences or draw conclusions about data as well as to make important
business decisions. Sometimes, it is not easy to infer by merely looking at the
results. In such cases, visualisation helps in better understanding of results
of the analysis.

Data visualisation means graphical or pictorial representation of the data using
graph, chart, etc. The purpose of plotting data is to visualise variation or
show relationships between variables.

Visualisation also helps to effectively communicate information to intended
users. Traffic symbols, ultrasound reports, Atlas book of maps, speedometer of a
vehicle, tuners of instruments are few examples of visualisation that we come
across in our daily lives.

Visualisation of data is effectively used in fields like health, finance,
science, mathematics, engineering, etc.

In this chapter, we will learn how to visualise data using Matplotlib library of
Python by plotting charts such as line, bar, scatter with respect to the various
types of data.

## 4.2 Plotting using Matplotlib ||section-4.2||

Matplotlib library is used for creating static, animated, and interactive
2D-plots or figures in Python. It can be installed using the following pip
command from the command prompt:

```sh
pip install matplotlib
```

For plotting using Matplotlib, we need to import its Pyplot module using the
following command:

```py exec
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
```

Here, plt is an alias or an alternative name for `matplotlib.pyplot`. We can use
any other alias also.

<Figure
    id="4.1"
    title="Figure 4.1: Components of a plot"
    images={[]}
/>

The pyplot module of matplotlib contains a collection of functions that can be
used to work on a plot. The `plot()` function of the pyplot module is used to
create a figure. A figure is the overall window where the outputs of pyplot
functions are plotted. A figure contains a plotting area, legend, axis labels,
ticks, title, etc. ([Figure 4.1](#figure-4.1)). Each function makes some change
to a figure: example, creates a figure, creates a plotting area in a figure,
plots some lines in a plotting area, decorates the plot with labels, etc.

It is always expected that the data presented through charts easily understood.
Hence, while presenting data we should always give a chart title, label the axis
of the chart and provide legend in case we have more than one plotted data.

To plot x versus y, we can write `plt.plot(x,y)`. The `show()` function is used
to display the figure created using the `plot()` function.

Let us consider that in a city, the maximum temperature of a day is recorded for
three consecutive days. [Program 4-1](#program-4.1) demonstrates how to plot
temperature values for the given dates. The output generated is a line chart.


<Program id="4.1" title="Program 4-1">

Plotting Temperature against Height

```py exec
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# list storing date in string format
date = ["25/12", "26/12", "27/12"]
# list storing temperature values
temp = [8.5, 10.5, 6.8]
# create a figure plotting temp versus date
plt.plot(date, temp)
# show the figure
plt.show()
```

<Figure
    id="4.2"
    title="Figure 4.2: Line chart as output of Program 4-1"
    images={[
        {
            src: import("./res/fig_4.2.webp"),
            alt: "Line chart as output of Program 4-1"
        }
    ]}
/>

</Program>

In [program 4-1](#program-4.1), `plot()` is provided with two parameters, which
indicates values for x-axis and y-axis, respectively. The x and y ticks are
displayed accordingly. As shown in [Figure 4.2](#figure-4.2), the `plot()`
function by default plots a line chart. We can click on the save button on the
output window and save the plot as an image. A figure can also be saved by using
`savefig()` function. The name of the figure is passed to the function as
parameter. For example:

```py
plt.savefig('x.png')
```

In the previous example, we used `plot()` function to plot a line graph. There
are different types of data available for analysis. The plotting methods allow
for a handful of plot types other than the default line plot, as listed in
[Table 4.1](#table-4.1). Choice of plot is determined by the type of data we
have.

<Table id="4.1" title="Table 4.1: List of Pyplot functions to plot different charts">
|                                                   |                                          |
| :------------------------------------------------ | :--------------------------------------- |
| `plot(*args[, scalex, scaley, data])`             | Plot x versus y as lines and/or markers. |
| `bar(x, height[, width, bottom, align, data])`    | Make a bar plot.                         |
| `boxplot(x[, notch, sym, vert, whis, ...])`       | Make a box and whisker plot.             |
| `hist(x[, bins, range, density, weights, ...])`   | Plot a histogram.                        |
| `pie(x[, explode, labels, colors, autopct, ...])` | Plot a pie chart.                        |
| `scatter(x, y[, s, c, marker, cmap, norm, ...])`  | A scatter plot of x versus y.            |
</Table>

## 4.3 Customisation of Plots ||section-4.3||

Pyplot library gives us numerous functions, which can be used to customise
charts such as adding titles or legends. Some of the customisation options are
listed in [Table 4.2](#table-4.2):

<Table id="4.2" title="Table 4.2: List of Pyplot functions to customise plots">
|                                        |                                                                 |
| :------------------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `grid([b, which, axis])`               | Configure the grid lines.                                       |
| `legend(*args, **kwargs)`              | Place a legend on the axes.                                     |
| `savefig(*args, **kwargs)`             | Save the current figure.                                        |
| `show(*args, **kw)`                    | Display all figures.                                            |
| `title(label[, fontdict, loc, pad])`   | Set a title for the axes.                                       |
| `xlabel(xlabel[, fontdict, labelpad])` | Set the label for the x-axis.                                   |
| `xticks([ticks, labels])`              | Get or set the current tick locations and labels of the x-axis. |
| `ylabel(ylabel[, fontdict, labelpad])` | Set the label for the y-axis.                                   |
| `yticks([ticks, labels])`              | Get or set the current tick locations and labels of the y-axis. |
</Table>

<Program id="4.2" title="Program 4-2">

Plotting a line chart of date versus temperature by adding Label on X and Y
axis, and adding a Title and Grids to the chart.

```py exec
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt 
date=["25/12","26/12","27/12"] 
temp=[8.5,10.5,6.8] 
plt.plot(date, temp) 
plt.xlabel("Date") #add the Label on x-axis 
plt.ylabel("Temperature") #add the Label on y-axis 
plt.title("Date wise Temperature") #add the title to the chart 
plt.grid(True) #add gridlines to the background 
plt.yticks(temp) 
plt.show()
```

<Figure
    id="4.3"
    title="Figure 4.3: Line chart as output of Program 4-2"
    images={[
        {
            src: import("./res/fig_4.3.webp"),
            alt: "Line chart as output of Program 4-2"
        }
    ]}
/>

</Program>

In the above example, we have used the xlabel, ylabel, title and yticks
functions. We can see that compared to [Figure 4.2](#figure-4.2), the
[Figure 4.3](#figure-4.3) conveys more meaning, easily. We will learn about
customisation of other plots in later sections.

<Think title="Think and Reflect">
On providing a single list or array to the `plot()` function, can matplotlib
generate values for both the x and y axis?
</Think>

### 4.3.1 Marker ||section-4.3.1||

We can make certain other changes to plots by passing various parameters to the
`plot()` function. In [Figure 4.3](#figure-4.3), we plot temperatures day-wise.
It is also possible to specify each point in the line through a marker.

A marker is any symbol that represents a data value in a line chart or a scatter
plot. [Table 4.3](#table-4.3) shows a list of markers along with their
corresponding symbol and description. These markers can be used in program
codes:

<Table id="4.3" title="Table 4.3: Some of the Matplotlib Markers">
| Marker | Symbol | Description    |
| ------ | ------ | :------------- |
| "."    |        | Point          |
| ","    |        | Pixel          |
| "o"    |        | Circle         |
| "v"    |        | triangle_down  |
| "^"    |        | triangle_up    |
| "\<"   |        | triangle_left  |
| ">"    |        | triangle_right |
| "1"    |        | tri_down       |
| "2"    |        | tri_up         |
| "3"    |        | tri_left       |
| "4"    |        | tri_right      |
| "8"    |        | octagon        |
| "s"    |        | square         |
| "p"    |        | pentagon       |
| "P"    |        | plus (filled)  |
| "*"    |        | star           |
| "h"    |        | hexagon1       |
| "H"    |        | hexagon2       |
| "+"    |        | plus           |
| "x"    |        | x              |
| "X"    |        | x (filled)     |
| "D"    |        | diamond        |          
</Table>

### 4.3.2 Colour ||section-4.3.2||

It is also possible to format the plot further by changing the colour of the
plotted data. [Table 4.4](#table-4.4) shows the list of colours that are supported. We can
either use character codes or the color names as values to the parameter color
in the `plot()`.

<Table id="4.4" title="Table 4.4: Colour abbreviations for plotting">
| Character | Colour  |
| --------- | ------- |
| 'b'       | blue    |
| 'g'       | green   |
| 'r'       | red     |
| 'c'       | cyan    |
| 'm'       | magenta |
| 'y'       | yellow  |
| 'k'       | black   |
| 'w'       | white   |
</Table>

### 4.3.3 Linewidth and Line Style ||section-4.3.3||

The linewidth and linestyle property can be used to change the width and the
style of the line chart. Linewidth is specified in pixels. The default line
width is 1 pixel showing a thin line. Thus, a number greater than 1 will output
a thicker line depending on the value provided.

We can also set the line style of a line chart using the linestyle parameter. It
can take a string such as "solid", "dotted", "dashed" or "dashdot". Let us write
the [Program 4-3](#program-4.3) applying some of the customisations.

<Program id="4.3" title="Program 4-3">

Consider the average heights and weights of persons aged 8 to 16 stored in the
following two lists:

```txt
height = [121.9, 124.5, 129.5, 134.6, 139.7, 147.3, 152.4, 157.5, 162.6]
```

```txt
weight = [19.7, 21.3, 23.5, 25.9, 28.5, 32.1, 35.7, 39.6, 43.2]
```

Let us plot a line chart where:

- i. x axis will represent weight
- ii. y axis will represent height
- iii. x axis label should be "Weight in kg"
- iv. y axis label should be "Height in cm"
- v. colour of the line should be green
- vi. use * as marker
- vii. Marker size as10
- viii.The title of the chart should be "Average weight with respect to average
  height".

- ix. Line style should be dashed
- x. Linewidth should be 2.

```py exec
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import pandas as pd

height = [121.9, 124.5, 129.5, 134.6, 139.7, 147.3, 152.4, 157.5, 162.6]
weight = [19.7, 21.3, 23.5, 25.9, 28.5, 32.1, 35.7, 39.6, 43.2]

df = pd.DataFrame({"height": height, "weight": weight})

# Set xlabel for the plot
plt.xlabel("Weight in kg")
# Set ylabel for the plot
plt.ylabel("Height in cm")
# Set chart title:
plt.title("Average weight with respect to average height")
# plot using marker'-*' and line colour as green
plt.plot(
    df.weight,
    df.height,
    marker="*",
    markersize=10,
    color="green",
    linewidth=2,
    linestyle="dashdot",
)
plt.show()
```

In the above we created the DataFrame using 2 lists, and in the plot function we
have passed the height and weight columns of the DataFrame. The output is shown
in [Figure 4.4](#figure-4.4).

<Figure
    id="4.4"
    title="Figure 4.4: Line chart showing average weight against average height"
    images={[
        {
            src: import("./res/fig_4.4.webp"),
            alt: "Line chart showing average weight against average height"
        }
    ]}
/>

</Program>

:::tip

Continuous data are measured while discrete data are obtained by counting.
Height, weight are examples of continuous data. It can be in decimals. Total
number of students in a class is discrete. It can never be in decimals.

## 4.4 the Pandas Plot functIon (Pandas VIsualIsatIon) ||section-4.4||

In [Programs 4-1](#program-4.1) and [4-2](#program-4.1), we learnt that the `plot()` function of the pyplot
module of matplotlib can be used to plot a chart. However, starting from version
0.17.0, Pandas objects Series and DataFrame come equipped with their own
`.plot()` methods. This `plot()` method is just a simple wrapper around the
`plot()` function of pyplot.

Thus, if we have a Series or DataFrame type object (let's say 's' or 'df') we
can call the plot method by writing: `s.plot()` or `df.plot()`


The `plot()` method of Pandas accepts a considerable number of arguments that can
be used to plot a variety of graphs. It allows customising different plot types
by supplying the kind keyword arguments. The general syntax is:
`plt.plot(kind)`, where kind accepts a string indicating the type of .plot, as
listed in [Table 4.5](#table-4.5). In addition, we can use the matplotlib.pyplot methods and
functions also along with the `plt()` method of Pandas objects.

<Table id="4.5" title="Table 4.5: Arguments accepted by kind for different plots">
| kind    | Plot type           |
| ------- | ------------------- |
| line    | Line plot (default) |
| bar     | Vertical bar plot   |
| barh    | Horizontal bar plot |
| hist    | Histogram           |
| box     | Boxplot             |
| area    | Area plot           |
| pie     | Pie plot            |
| scatter | Scatter plot        |
</Table>

In the previous chapters, we have learned to store different types of data in a
two dimensional format using DataFrame. In the subsequent sections we will learn
to use `plot()` function to create various types of charts with respect to the
type of data stored in DataFrames.

### 4.4.1 Plotting a Line chart ||section-4.4.1||

A line plot is a graph that shows the frequency of data along a number line. It
is used to show continuous dataset. A line plot is used to visualise growth or
decline in data over a time interval. We have already plotted line charts
through [Programs 4-1](#program-4.1) and [4-2](#program-4.2). In this section, we will learn to plot a line
chart for data stored in a DataFrame.

<Activity id="4.1" title="Activity 4.1">
Create the MelaSale.csv using Python Pandas containing data as shown in [Table 4.6](#table-4.6).
</Activity>

<Program id="4.4" title="Program 4-4">

Smile NGO has participated in a three week cultural mela. Using Pandas, they
have stored the sales (in Rs) made day wise for every week in a CSV file named
"MelaSales.csv", as shown in [Table 4.6](#table-4.6).

<Table title="Table 4.6: Day-wise mela sales data">
| Week 1 | Week 2 | Week 3 |
| ------ | ------ | ------ |
| 5000   | 4000   | 4000   |
| 5900   | 3000   | 5800   |
| 6500   | 5000   | 3500   |
| 3500   | 5500   | 2500   |
| 4000   | 3000   | 3000   |
| 5300   | 4300   | 5300   |

Depict the sales for the three weeks using a Line chart. It should have the
following:

- ii. axis label as Days.
- iii. axis label as "Sales in Rs".

Line colours are red for week 1, blue for week 2 and brown for week 3.

<Collapse title="Create CSV">

```py exec
import pandas as pd

# Create a DataFrame from the given data
data = {
    "Week 1": [5000, 5900, 6500, 3500, 4000, 5300, 7900],
    "Week 2": [4000, 3000, 5000, 5500, 3000, 4300, 5900],
    "Week 3": [4000, 5800, 3500, 2500, 3000, 5300, 6000],
}

df.plot(kind="line", color=["red", "blue", "brown"])
# Set title to "Mela Sales Report"

# Label x axis as "Days"
plt.xlabel("Days")
# Label y axis as "Sales in Rs"
plt.ylabel("Sales in Rs")
# Display the figure
plt.show()

</Program>

The [Figure 4.5](#figure-4.5) displays a line plot as output for
[Program 4-4](#program-4.4). Note that the legend is displayed by default
associating the colours with the plotted data.

<Figure
    id="4.5"
    title="Figure 4.5: Line plot showing mela sales figures"
    images={[
        {
            src: import("./res/fig_4.5.webp"),
            alt: "Line plot showing mela sales figures"
        }
    ]}
/>

The line plot takes a numeric value to display on the x axis and hence uses the
index (row labels) of the DataFrame in the above example. Thus, x tick values
are the index of the DataFramedf that contains data stored in MelaSales.CSV.

#### Customising Line Plot

We can substitute the ticks at x axis with a list of values of our choice by
using `plt.xticks(ticks,label)` where ticks is a list of locations(locs) on x axis
at which ticks should be placed, label is a list of items to place at the given
ticks.

<Program id="4.5" title="Program 4-5">

Assuming the same CSV file, i.e., MelaSales.csv, plot the line chart with
following customisations:

```txt
Maker = "*" 
Marker size = 10 
linestyle = "--" 
Linewidth = 3
```

```py exec
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

df = pd.read_csv("MelaSales.csv")
# creates plot of different color for each week
df.plot(
    kind="line",
    color=["red", "blue", "brown"],
    marker="*",
    markersize=10,
    linewidth=3,
    linestyle="--",
)
plt.title("Mela Sales Report")
plt.xlabel("Days")
plt.ylabel("Sales in Rs")
# store converted index of DataFrame to a list
ticks = df.index.tolist()
# displays corresponding day on x axis
plt.xticks(ticks, df.Day)
plt.show()
```

</Program>

[Figure 4.6](#figure-4.6) is generated as output of [Program 4-5](#program-4.5) with xticks as
Day names.

<Figure
    id="4.6"
    title="Figure 4.6: Line plot showing mela sales figures with day names"
    images={[
        {
            src: import("./res/fig_4.6.webp"),
            alt: "Line plot showing mela sales figures with day names"
        }
    ]}
/>

### 4.4.2 Plotting Bar Chart ||section-4.4.2||

The line plot in [Figure 4.6](#figure-4.6) shows that the sales for all the weeks increased
during the weekend. Other than weekends, it also shows that the sales increased
on Wednesday for Week 1, on Thursday for Week 2 and on Tuesday for Week 3.

But, the lines are unable to efficiently depict comparison between the weeks for
which the sales data is plotted. In order to show comparisons, we prefer Bar
charts. Unlike line plots, bar charts can plot strings on the x axis. To plot a
bar chart, we will specify kind='bar'. We can also specify the DataFrame columns
to be used as x and y axes.

Let us now add a column "Days" consisting of day names to "MelaSales.csv" as
shown in [Table 4.7](#table-4.7).

<Table title="Table 4.7: Day-wise sales data along with Day's names">
| Week 1 | Week 2 | Week 3 | Day       |
| ------ | ------ | ------ | --------- |
| 5000   | 4000   | 4000   | Monday    |
| 5900   | 3000   | 5800   | Tuesday   |
| 6500   | 5000   | 3500   | Wednesday |

bar plot will plot all the columns of the DataFrame with the index (row label)
of DataFrame at x axis which is a numeric starting from 0.

#### Customising Bar Chart

We can also customise the bar chart by adding certain parameters to the plot
function. We can control the edgecolor of the bar, linestyle and linewidth. We
can also control the color of the lines. The following example shows various
customisations on the bar chart of [Figure 4.8](#figure-4.8)

<Program id="4.7" title="Program 4-7">

Let us write a Python script to display Bar plot for the "MelaSales.csv" file
with column Day on x axis, and having the following customisation:

- Changing the color of each bar to red, yellow and purple.
- Edge Color to green
- Linewidth as 2
- Line style as `--`

```py exec
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

df = pd.read_csv("MelaSales.csv")
# plots a bar chart with the column "Days" as x axis
df.plot(
    kind="bar",
    x="Day",
    title="Mela Sales Report",
    color=["red", "yellow", "purple"],
    edgecolor="Green",
    linewidth=2,
    linestyle="--",
)
# set title and set ylabel
plt.ylabel("Sales in Rs")
plt.show()
```

### 4.4.3 Plotting Histogram ||section-4.4.3||

Histograms are column-charts, where each column represents a range of values,
and the height of a column corresponds to how many values are in that range.

To make a histogram, the data is sorted into "bins" and the number of data
points in each bin is counted. The height of each column in the histogram is
then proportional to the number of data points its bin contains.

:::tip

If we do not specify Bins are the number of intervals you want to divide all of
your data into, such that it can be displayed as bars on a histogram.

:::

The `df.plot(kind='hist')` function automatically selects the size of the bins
based on the spread of values in the data.

<Program id="4.8" title="Program 4-8">

```py exec
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

data = {
    "Name": ["Arnav", "Sheela", "Azhar", "Bincy", "Yash", "Nazar"],
    "Height": [60, 61, 63, 65, 61, 60],
    "Weight": [47, 89, 52, 58, 50, 47],
}

df = pd.DataFrame(data)
df.plot(kind="hist")
plt.show()
```

</Program>

The [Program 4-8](#program-4.8) displays the histogram corresponding to all
attributes having numeric values, i.e., 'Height' and 'Weight' attributes as
shown in [Figure 4.9](#figure-4.9). On the basis of the height and weight values provided in
the DataFrame, the `plot()` calculated the bin values.

<Figure
    id="4.9"
    title="Figure 4.9: A histogram as output of Program 4-8"
    images={[
        {
            src: import("./res/fig_4.9.webp"),
            alt: "A histogram as output of Program 4-8"
        }
    ]}
/>

It is also possible to set value for the bins parameter, for example,

```py
df.plot(kind="hist", bins=20)
df.plot(kind="hist", bins=[18, 19, 20, 21, 22])
df.plot(kind="hist", bins=range(18, 25))
```

#### Customising Histogram

Taking the same data as above, now let see how the histogram can be customised.
Let us change the edgecolor, which is the border of each hist, to green. Also,
let us change the line style to ":" and line width to 2. Let us try another
property called fill, which takes boolean values. The default True means each
hist will be filled with color and False means each hist will be empty. Another
property called hatch can be used to fill to each hist with pattern ( '`-`', '`+`',
'`x`', '`\\`', '`*`', '`o`', '`O`', '`.`'). In the [Program 4-9](#program-4.9), we have used
the hatch value as "o".

<Program id="4.9" title="Program 4-9">

```py
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

data = {
    "Name": ["Arnav", "Sheela", "Azhar", "Bincy", "Yash", "Nazar"],
    "Height": [60, 61, 63, 65, 61, 60],
    "Weight": [47, 89, 52, 58, 50, 47],
}
df = pd.DataFrame(data)
df.plot(
    kind="hist",
    edgecolor="Green",
    linewidth=2,
    linestyle=":",
    fill=False,
    hatch="o",
)
plt.show()
```

#### Using Open Data

There are many websites that provide data freely for anyone to download and do
analysis, primarily for educational purposes. These are called Open Data as the
data source is open to the public. Availability of data for access and use
promotes further analysis and innovation. A lot of emphasis is being given to
open data to ensure transparency, accessibility and innovation. "Open Government
Data (OGD) Platform India" (data.gov.in) is a platform for supporting the Open
Data initiative of the Government of India. Large datasets on different projects
and parameters are available on the platform.

Let us consider a dataset called **"Seasonal and Annual Min/Max Temp Series -
India from 1901 to 2017"** from the URL
[https://data.gov.in/resource/seasonal-and-annual-minmax-temp-series-india-1901-2017](https://data.gov.in/resource/seasonal-and-annual-minmax-temp-series-india-1901-2017).
Our aim is to plot the minimum and maximum temperature and observe the number of
times (frequency) a particular temperature has occurred. We only need to extract
the 'ANNUAL -MIN' and 'ANNUAL -MAX' columns from the file. Also, let us aim to
display two Histogram plots:

- i) Only for 'ANNUAL - MIN'
- ii) For both 'ANNUAL - MIN' and 'ANNUAL - MAX'

### 4.4.4 Plotting Scatter Chart ||section-4.4.4||

A scatter chart is a two-dimensional data visualisation method that uses dots to
represent the values obtained for two different variables —one plotted along the
x-axis and the other plotted along the y-axis. Scatter plots are used when you
want to show the relationship between two variables. Scatter plots are sometimes
called correlation plots because they show how two variables are correlated.
Additionally, the size, shape or color of the dot could represent a third (or
even fourth variable).

<Program id="4.12" title="Program 4-12">

Prayatna sells designer bags and wallets. During the sales season, he gave
discounts ranging from 10% to 50% over a period of 5 weeks. He recorded his

bubble as 10 times the discount, as shown in [Figure 4.15](#figure-4.15). The colour and markers
can also be changed in the above plot by adding the following statements:

### 4.4.5 Plotting Quartiles and Box plot ||section-4.4.5||

Suppose an entrance examination of 200 marks is conducted at the national level,
and Mahi has topped the exam by scoring 120 marks. The result shows 100
percentile against Mahi's name, which means all the candidates excluding Mahi
have scored less than Mahi. To visualise this kind of data, we use quartiles.

Quartiles are the measures which divide the data into four equal parts, and each
part contains an equal number of observations. Calculating quartiles requires
calculation of median. Quartiles are often used in educational achievement data,
sales and survey data to divide populations into groups. For example, you can
use Quartile to find the top 25 percent of students in that examination.

A Box Plot is the visual representation of the statistical summary of a given
data set. The summary includes Minimum value, Quartile 1, Quartile 2, Median,
Quartile 4 and Maximum value. The whiskers are the two lines outside the box
that extend to the highest and lowest values. It also helps in identifying the
outliers. An outlier is an observation that is numerically distant from the rest
of the data, as shown in [Figure 4.16](#figure-4.16):

#### Customising Box plot

We can display the whisker in horizontal direction by adding a parameter
vert=False in the [Program 4-15](#figure-4.15), as shown in the following line of code. We can
change the color of the whisker as well. The output of the modified Program is
shown in [Figure 4.19](#figure-4.19).

```py exec
df.plot(
    kind="box",
    title="Compare Resorts",
    color="red",
    vert=False,
)

plt.show()
```

### 4.4.6 Plotting Pie Chart ||section-4.4.6||

Pie is a type of graph in which a circle is divided into different sectors and
each sector represents a part of the whole. A pie plot is used to represent
numerical data proportionally. To plot a pie chart, either column label y or
'subplots=True' should be set while using `df.plot(kind='pie')`. If no column
reference is passed and subplots=True, a 'pie' plot is drawn for each numerical
column independently.

In the [Program 4.16](#program-4.16), we have a DataFrame with information about
the planet's mass and radius. The 'mass' column is passed to the plot() function
to get a pie plot as shown in [Figure 4.20](#figure-4.20).

<Program id="4.16" title="Program 4-16">

```py exec
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

df = pd.DataFrame(
    {
        "mass": [0.330, 4.87, 5.97], 
        "radius": [2439.7, 6051.8, 6378.1],
    },
    index=["Mercury", "Venus", "Earth"],
)
df.plot(kind="pie", y="mass")
plt.show()
```

<Figure
    id="4.20"
    title="Figure 4.20: Pie chart as output of Program 4-16"
    images={[
        {
            src: import("./res/fig_4.20.webp"),
            alt: "Pie chart as output of Program 4-16"
        }
    ]}
/>

</Program>

It is important to note that the default label names are the index value of the
DataFrame. The labels as shown in [Figure 4.20](#figure-4.20) are the names of
the planet which are the index values as shown in [Program 4.16](#program-4.16).

<Program id="4.17" title="Program 4-17">

Let us consider the dataset of [Table 4.10](#table-4.10) showing the forest
cover of north eastern states that contains geographical area and corresponding
forest cover in sq km along with the names of the corresponding states.

<Table title="Table 4.10: Forest cover of North Eastern states">

#### Customisation of pie chart

To customise the pie plot of [Figure 4.21](#figure-4.12), we have added the following two
properties of pie chart in [program 4-18](#program-4.18):

- Explode—it specifies the fraction of the radius with which to explode or
  expand each slot.

- Autopct—to display the percentage of that part as a label.

<Program id="4.18" title="Program 4-18">

```py exec
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

df = pd.DataFrame(
    {

exp = [0.1, 0, 0, 0, 0.2, 0, 0]
# explode the first wedge to .1 level and fifth to level 2.
c = ["r", "g", "m", "c", "brown", "pink", "purple"]
# change the color of each wedge
df.plot(

## Summary

<Summary>
- A plot is a graphical representation of a data set which is also
  interchangeably known as a graph or chart. It is used to show the relationship
  between two or more variables.

- In order to be able to use Python's Data Visualisation library, we need to
  import the pyplot module from Matplotlib library using the following
  statement: import matplotlib.pyplot as plt, where plt is an alias or an
  alternative name for matplotlib.pyplot. You can keep any alias of your choice.

- The pyplot module houses functions to create a figure(plot), create a plotting
  area in a figure, plot lines, bars, hist. etc., in a plotting area, decorate
  the plot with labels, etc.

- The various components of a plot are: Title, Legend, Ticks, x label, ylabel

- `plt.plot()` is used to build a plot, where plt is an alias.

- `plt.show()` is used to display the figure, where plt is an alias.

- `plt.xlabel()` and `plt.ylabel()` are used to set the x and y label of the
  plot.

- `plt.title()` can be used to display the title of a plot.

- It is possible to plot data directly from the DataFrame.

- Pandas has a built-in `.plot()` function as part of the DataFrame class.

- The general format of plotting a DataFrame is `df.plot(kind = ' ')` where df
  is the name of the DataFrame and kind can be line, bar, hist, scatter, box
  depending upon the type of plot to be displayed.
