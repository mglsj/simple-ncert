## 1.1 Introduction ||section-1.1||

In Class XI, we have understood database concepts and learned how to create
databases using MySQL. We have also learnt how to populate, manipulate and
retrieve data from a database using SQL queries.

In this chapter, we are going to learn more SQL commands which are required to
perform various queries in a database. We will understand how to use single row
functions, multiple row functions, arranging records in ascending or descending
order, grouping records based on some criteria, and working on multiple tables
using SQL.

Let us create a database called CARSHOWROOM, having the schema as shown in
[Figure 1.1](#figure-1.1). It has the following four relations:

- **INVENTORY:** Stores name, price, model, year of manufacturing, and fuel type
  for each car in inventory of the showroom,

- **CUSTOMER:** Stores customer Id, name, address, phone number and email for
  each customer,

- **SALE:** Stores the invoice number, car Id, customer id, sale date, mode of
  payment, sales person's employee Id, and selling price of the car sold,

- **EMPLOYEE:** Stores employee Id, name, date of birth, date of joining,
  designation, and salary of each employee in the showroom.

            alt: "Schema diagram of database CARSHOWROOM"
        }
    ]}
/>

The records of the four relations are shown in [Tables 1.1](#table-1.1), [1.2](#table-1.2), 
[1.3](#table-1.3), and [1.4](#table-1.4) respectively.

## 1.2 Functions in SQL ||section-1.2||

We know that a function is used to perform some particular task and it returns
zero or more values as a result. Functions are useful while writing SQL queries
also. Functions can be applied to work on single or multiple records (rows) of a
table. Depending on their application in one or multiple rows, SQL functions are
categorised as Single row functions and Aggregate functions.

### 1.2.1 Single Row Functions ||section-1.2.1||

These are also known as Scalar functions. Single row functions are applied on a
single value and return a single value. [Figure 1.2](#figure-1.2) lists different single row
functions under three categories â€” Numeric (Math), String, Date and Time. Math
functions accept numeric value as input, and return a numeric value as a result.
String functions accept character value as input, and return either character or
numeric values as output. Date and time functions accept date and time values as
input, and return numeric or string, or date and time values as output.

            alt: "Three categories of single row functions in SQL"
        }
    ]}
/>

#### (A) Numeric Functions ||section-1.2.1.a||

Three commonly used numeric functions are `POWER()`, `ROUND()` and `MOD()`.
Their usage along with syntax is given in [Table 1.5](#table-1.5).

<Example id="1.1" title="Example 1.1">

In order to increase sales, suppose the car dealer decides to offer his
customers to pay the total amount in 10 easy EMIs (equal monthly installments).
Assume that EMIs are required to be in multiples of 10,000. For that, the dealer
wants to list the CarID and Price along with the following data from the
Inventory table:

- a) Calculate GST as 12% of Price and display the result after rounding it off
  to one decimal place.

#### (B) String Functions ||section-1.2.1.b||

String functions can perform various operations on alphanumeric data which are
stored in a table. They can be used to change the case (uppercase to lowercase
or vice-versa), extract a substring, calculate the length of a string and so on.
String functions and their usage are shown in [Table 1.6](#table-1.6).

### 1.2.2 Aggregate Functions

Aggregate functions are also called multiple row functions. These functions work
on a set of records as a whole, and return a single value for each column of the
records on which the function is applied. [Table 1.8](#table-1.8) shows the differences
between single row functions and multiple row functions. [Table 1.9](#table-1.9) describes
some of the aggregate functions along with their usage. Note that column must be
of numeric type.

<Table id="1.8" title="Table 1.8 Differences between Single row and Multiple row Functions" center={false}>
| Single Row Functions                                                  | Multiple Row Functions                                                                   |
| --------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| It operates on a single row at a time.                                | It operates on groups of rows.                                                           |
| It returns one result per row.                                        | It returns one result for a group of rows.                                               |
| It can be used in Select, Where, and Order by clause.                 | It can be used in the select clause only.                                                |
| Math, String and Date functions are examples of single row functions. | `Max()`, `Min()`, `Avg()`, `Sum()`, `Count()` and `Count(*)` are examples of multiple row functions. |

## 1.3 `GROUP BY` in SQL ||section-1.3||

At times we need to fetch a group of rows on the basis of common values in a
column. This can be done using a `GROUP BY` clause. It groups the rows together
that contain the same values in a specified column. We can use the aggregate
functions (`COUNT`, `MAX`, `MIN`, `AVG` and `SUM`) to work on the grouped values. HAVING
Clause in SQL is used to specify conditions on the rows with `GROUP BY` clause.

Consider the SALE table from the CARSHOWROOM database:

<Card>
```sql
SELECT * FROM SALE;
```
```ansi
+-----------+------+-------+------------+------------------+------+------------+------------+ 
|InvoiceNo  |CarId |CustId | SaleDate   | PaymentMode      |EmpID | SalePrice  | Commission | 
+-----------+------+-------+------------+------------------+------+------------+------------+ 
|I00001     |D001  |C0001  |2019-01-24  | Credit Card      | E004 | 613247.00  | 73589.64   |

|I00005     |E001  |C0003  |2018-12-20  | Credit Card      | E002 | 369310.00  | 44317.20   | 
|I00006     |S002  |C0002  |2019-01-30  | Bank Finance     | E007 | 620214.00  | 74425.68   | 
+-----------+------+-------+------------+------------------+------+------------+------------+ 
6 rows in set (0.11 sec)
```
</Card>

CarID, CustID, SaleDate, PaymentMode, EmpID, SalePrice are the columns that can
have rows with the same values in it. So, `GROUP BY` clause can be used
in these columns to find the number of records of a particular type (column), or
to calculate the sum of the price of each car type.

<Example id="1.6" title="Example 1.6">

## 1.4 Operations on Relations ||section-1.4||

We can perform certain operations on relations like Union, Intersection, and Set
Difference to merge the tuples of two tables. These three operations are binary
operations as they work upon two tables. Note here, that these operations can
only be applied if both the relations have the same number of attributes, and
corresponding attributes in both tables have the same domain.

### 1.4.1 UNION ($âˆª$) ||section-1.4.1||

This operation is used to combine the selected rows of two tables at a time. If
some rows are the same in both the tables, then the result of the Union
operation will show those rows only once. [Figure 1.3](#figure-1.3) shows union of two sets.

<Figure
    id="1.3"
    title="Figure 1.3 Union of two sets"
    images={[
        {
            src: import("./res/fig_1.3.svg"),
            srcDark: import("./res/fig_1.3.dark.svg"),
            alt: "Union of two sets"
        }
    ]}
    halfWidth={true}
/>

Let us consider two relations DANCE and MUSIC shown in [Tables 1.10](#table-1.10) and 
[1.11](#table-1.11) respectively.

<Table id="1.10" title="Table 1.10 DANCE" center={false}>
```ansi
+------+--------+-------+ 
| SNo  | Name   | Class | 
+------+--------+-------+ 
| 1    | Aastha | 7A    | 
| 2    | Mahira | 6A    | 
| 3    | Mohit  | 7B    | 
| 4    | Sanjay | 7A    | 
+------+--------+-------+
```
</Table>

<Table id="1.11" title="Table 1.11 MUSIC" center={false}>
```ansi
+------+---------+-------+ 
| SNo  | Name    | Class | 
+------+---------+-------+ 
| 1    | Mehak   | 8A    | 
| 2    | Mahira  | 6A    | 
| 3    | Lavanya | 7A    | 
| 4    | Sanjay  | 7A    | 
| 5    | Abhay   | 8A    | 
+------+---------+-------+
```
</Table>

If we need the list of students participating in either of events, then we have
to apply UNION operation (represented by symbol $âˆª$) on relations DANCE and
MUSIC. The output of UNION operation is shown in [Table 1.12](#table-1.12).

<Table id="1.12" title="Table 1.12 DANCE âˆª MUSIC" center={false}>
```ansi
+-----+---------+-------+ 
| SNo | Name    | Class | 
+-----+---------+-------+ 
| 1   | Aastha  | 7A    | 
| 2   | Mahira  | 6A    | 
| 3   | Mohit   | 7B    | 
| 4   | Sanjay  | 7A    | 
| 1   | Mehak   | 8A    | 
| 3   | Lavanya | 7A    | 
| 5   | Abhay   | 8A    | 
+-----+---------+-------+
```
</Table>

### 1.4.2 INTERSECT ($âˆ©$) ||section-1.4.2||

Intersect operation is used to get the common tuples from two tables and is
represented by the symbol $âˆ©$. [Figure 1.4](#figure-1.4) shows intersection of two sets.

<Figure
    id="1.4"
    title="Figure 1.4 Intersection of two sets"
    images={[
        {
            src: import("./res/fig_1.4.svg"),
            srcDark: import("./res/fig_1.4.dark.svg"),
            alt: "Intersection of two sets"
        }
    ]}
    halfWidth={true}
/>

Suppose we have to display the list of students who are participating in both
the events (DANCE and MUSIC), then intersection operation is to be applied on
these two tables. The output of INTERSECT operation is shown in [Table 1.13](#table-1.13).

<Table id="1.13" title="Table 1.13 DANCE âˆ© MUSIC" center={false}>
```ansi
+------+---------+-------+ 
| SNo  | Name    | Class | 
+------+---------+-------+ 
| 2    | Mahira  | 6A    | 
| 4    | Sanjay  | 7A    | 
+------+---------+-------+
```
</Table>

### 1.4.3 MINUS ($-$) ||section-1.4.3||

This operation is used to get tuples/rows which are in the first table but not
in the second table, and the operation is represented by the symbol $-$(minus).
[Figure 1.5](#figure-1.5) shows minus operation (also called set difference) between two sets.

<Figure
    id="1.5"
    title="Figure 1.5 Difference of two sets"
    images={[
        {
            src: import("./res/fig_1.5.svg"),
            srcDark: import("./res/fig_1.5.dark.svg"),
            alt: "Difference of two sets"
        }
    ]}
    halfWidth={true}
/>

Suppose, we want the list of students who are only participating in MUSIC and
not in DANCE event. Then, we will use the MINUS operation, whose output is given
in [Table 1.14](#table-1.14).

<Table id="1.14" title="Table 1.14 DANCE - MUSIC" center={false}>

### 1.4.4 Cartesian Product ||section-1.4.4||

Cartesian product operation combines tuples from two relations. It results in
all pairs of rows from the two input relations, regardless of whether or not
they have the same values on common attributes. It is denoted as '$Ã—$'.

The degree of the resulting relation is calculated as the sum of the degrees of
both the relations under consideration. The cardinality of the resulting
relation is calculated as the product of the cardinality of relations on which
cartesian product is applied. Let us use the relations DANCE and MUSIC to show
the output of cartesian product. Note that both relations are of degree 3. The
cardinality of relations DANCE and MUSIC is 4 and 5 respectively. Applying
cartesian product on these two relations will result in a relation of degree 6
and cardinality 20, as shown in [Table 1.15](#table-1.15).

## 1.5 Using two Relations in a Query ||section-1.5||

Till now, we have written queries in SQL using a single relation only. In this
section, we will learn to write queries using two relations.

### 1.5.1 Cartesian product on two tables ||section-1.5.1||

From the previous section, we learnt that application of operator cartesian
product on two tables results in a table having all combinations of tuples from
the underlying tables. When more than one table is to be used in a query, then
we must specify the table names by separating commas in the `FROM` clause, as
shown in [Example 1.7](#example-1.7). On execution of such a query, the DBMS (MySql) will first
apply cartesian product on specified tables to have a single table. The
following query of [Example 1.7](#example-1.7) applies cartesian product on the two tables DANCE
and MUSIC:

<Example id="1.7" title="Example 1.7">

- a) Display all possible combinations of tuples of relations DANCE and MUSIC
  ```sql
  SELECT *
  FROM DANCE,
      MUSIC;
  ```
  As we are using SELECT * in the query, the output will be the Table 1.15
  having degree 6 and cardinality 20.

- b) From the all possible combinations of tuples of relations DANCE and MUSIC,
  display only those rows such that the attribute name in both have the same
  value.
  ```sql
  SELECT *
  FROM DANCE D,
      MUSIC M
  WHERE D.Name = M.Name;
  ```

<Table id="1.16" title="Table 1.16 Tuples with same name" center={false}>
```ansi
+------+--------+-------+------+--------+-------+ 
| Sno  | Name   | Class | Sno  | Name   | class | 
+------+--------+-------+------+--------+-------+ 
| 2    | Mahira | 6A    | 2    | Mahira | 6A    | 
| 4    | Sanjay | 7A    | 4    | Sanjay | 7A    | 
+------+--------+-------+------+--------+-------+ 
2 rows in set (0.00 sec)
```
</Table>
</Example>

Note that in this query we have used table aliases (D for DANCE and M for
MUSIC), just like column aliases to refer to tables by shortened names. It is
important to note that table alias is valid only for current query and the
original table name cannot be used in the query if its alias is given in `FROM`
clause.

### 1.5.2 `JOIN` on two tables ||section-1.5.2||

`JOIN` operation combines tuples from two tables on specified conditions. This is
unlike cartesian product, which make all possible combinations of tuples. While
using the `JOIN` clause of SQL, we specify conditions on the related attributes of
two tables within the `FROM` clause. Usually, such an attribute is the primary key
in one table and foreign key in another table. Let us create two tables UNIFORM
(UCode, UName, UColor) and COST (UCode, Size, Price) in the SchoolUniform
database. UCode is Primary Key in table UNIFORM. UCode and Size is the Composite
Key in table COST. Therefore, Ucode is a common attribute between the two tables
which can be used to fetch the common data from both the tables. Hence, we need
to define Ucode as foreign key in the Price table while creating this table.

<Table id="1.17" title="Table 1.17 Uniform table" center={false}>
```ansi
+-------+-------+--------+ 
| Ucode | Uname | Ucolor | 
+-------+-------+--------+ 
| 1     | Shirt | White  | 
| 2     | Pant  | Grey   | 
| 3     | Tie   | Blue   | 
+-------+-------+--------+
```
</Table>

<Table id="1.18" title="Table 1.18 Cost table" center={false}>
```ansi
+-------+------+-------+ 
| Ucode | Size | Price | 
+-------+------+-------+ 
| 1     | L    | 580   | 
| 1     | M    | 500   |  
| 2     | L    | 890   | 
| 2     | M    | 810   | 
+-------+------+-------+
```
</Table>

<Example id="1.7" title="Example 1.7">

List the UCode, UName, UColor, Size and Price of related tuples of tables
UNIFORM and COST. The given query may be written in three different ways as
given below:

- a) Using condition in `WHERE` clause

```sql
SELECT *
FROM UNIFORM U,
    COST C
WHERE U.UCode = C.UCode;
```

<Table id="1.19" title="Table 1.19 Output of the query" center={false}>
```ansi
+-------+-------+--------+-------+---------+-------+ 
| UCode | UName | UColor | Ucode | Size    | Price | 
+-------+-------+--------+-------+---------+-------+ 
| 1     | Shirt | White  | 1     | L       | 580   | 
| 1     | Shirt | White  | 1     | M       | 500   | 
| 2     | Pant  | Grey   | 2     | L       | 890   | 
| 2     | Pant  | Grey   | 2     | M       | 810   | 
+-------+-------+--------+-------+---------+-------+ 
4 rows in set (0.08 sec)
```
</Table>

As the attribute Ucode is in both tables, we need to use table alias to remove
ambiguity. Hence, we have used qualifier with attribute UCode in `SELECT` and `FROM`
clauses to indicate its scope.

- b) Explicit use of `JOIN` clause

```sql
SELECT *
FROM UNIFORM U
    JOIN COST C ON U.Ucode = C.Ucode;
```

The output of the query is the same as shown in [Table 1.19](#table-1.19). In this query, we
have used `JOIN` clause explicitly along with condition in `FROM` clause. Hence, no
condition needs to be given in WHERE clause.

- c) Explicit use of `NATURAL JOIN` clause

The output of queries (a) and (b) shown in [Table 1.19](#table-1.19) has a repetitive column
Ucode having exactly the same values. This redundant column provides no
additional information. There is an extension of `JOIN` operation called `NATURAL
JOIN` which works similar to `JOIN` clause in SQL, but removes the redundant
attribute. This operator can be used notes to join the contents of two tables
iff there is one common attribute in both the tables. The above SQL query using
`NATURAL JOIN` is shown below:

<Card>
```sql
SELECT *
FROM UNIFORM
    NATURAL JOIN COST;
```
```ansi
+-------+-------+--------+------+-------+ 
| UCode | UName | UColor | Size | Price | 
+-------+-------+--------+------+-------+ 
| 1     | Shirt | White  | L    | 580   | 
| 1     | Shirt | White  | M    | 500   | 
| 2     | Pant  | Grey   | L    | 890   | 
| 2     | Pant  | Grey   | M    | 810   | 
+-------+-------+--------+------+-------+ 
4 rows in set (0.17 sec)
```
</Card>

It is clear from the output that the result of this query is same as that of
queries written in (a) and (b), except that the attribute Ucode appears only
once.

</Example>

Following are some of the points to be considered while applying `JOIN` operations
on two or more relations:

- If two tables are to be joined on equality condition on the common attribute, 
  then one may use JOIN with ON clause or `NATURAL JOIN` in `FROM` clause. If three tables 
  are to be joined on equality condition, then two `JOIN` or `NATURAL JOIN` are required.

- In general, N-1 joins are needed to combine N tables on equality condition.

- With `JOIN` clause, we may use any relational operators to combine tuples of two
  tables.

## Summary

<Summary>
- A Function is used to perform a particular task and return a value as a result.

- Single row functions work on a single row to return a single value.

- Multiple row functions work on a set of records as a whole and return a single value.

- Numeric functions perform operations on numeric values and return numeric values.

- String functions perform operations on character type values and return either character or numeric values.

- Date and time functions allow us to deal with date type data values.

- `GROUP BY` function is used to group the rows together that contain similar values
  in a specified column. Some of the group functions are `COUNT`, `MAX`, `MIN`, `AVG` and
  `SUM`.

- Join is an operation which is used to combine rows from two or more tables based
  on one or more common fields between them.
